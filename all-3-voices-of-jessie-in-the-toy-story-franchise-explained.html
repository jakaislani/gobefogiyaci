The role earned the actress an Annie Award, the most important in animation, for Best Female Voice Acting in a Feature Production.</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=584 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cusack reprised the role in both Toy Story 3 and Toy Story 4</a>, as well as two of the short films from the 2011 series Toy Story Toons, the aforementioned Toy Story of Terror! and 2014’s Toy Story That Time Forgot. The actress is perhaps best known for her turn as Sheila Jackson in the Showtime&nbsp;dramedy Shameless.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Who else has voiced Jessie?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=649 data-current-count=949 data-injectable=true>It’s not actually Joan Cusack singing in that heartbreaking flashback sequence in Toy Story 2 when Jessie tells Woody all about her former life with her previous owner Emily. That voice you hear in the Grammy-winning song is actually Sarah McLachlan’s. The Canadian singer went on to perform it at the Oscars, but despite its Grammy victory in Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media category, McLachlan and iconic Toy Story songwriter Randy Newman didn’t take home the Academy Award. McLachlan has produced a total of nine studio albums, including 1997’s Surfacing and 2014’s Shine On.</p><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>In most other instances not previously mentioned, Jessie is voiced by actress Kat Cressida. The experienced voice-over artist lends her abilities to the beloved character in the video game Disney Infinity as well as theme park rides like Toy&nbsp;Story&nbsp;Mania!. Cressida also voiced Dee Dee in Cartoon Networks’ Dexter’s Laboratory.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKWkXWh6t7vInJysZZ%2Bbequx0qygnmWZo3q1tMRmq6ixXajBsL7YZp2rmZ6Ytaq%2FxGacsaiclravscNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./liraz-russo.html><span>←</span><span>Liraz Russo</span></a>
