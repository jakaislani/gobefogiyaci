<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Big Fish movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2003)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Some, however, find old Edward heroic and charming, and his wife is one of them. Sandra (<a href=#>Jessica Lange</a>) stands watch in the upper bedroom where her husband is leaving life as lugubriously as he lived it. She summons home their son, Will (<a href=#>Billy Crudup</a>). Will, a journalist working in Paris, knows his father's stories by heart and has one final exasperated request: Could his father now finally tell him the truth? Old Edward harrumphs, shifts some phlegm, and starts recycling again.</p><p><a href=#>Tim Burton</a> directed the movie, and we sense his eagerness to plunge into the flashbacks, which show Young Edward (<a href=#>Ewan McGregor</a>) and Young Sandra (<a href=#>Alison Lohman</a>) actually having some of the adventures the old man tirelessly recounts. Those memories involve a witch (<a href=#>Helena Bonham-Carter</a>) whose glass eye reflects the way her visitors will die, and a circus run by Amos Calloway (<a href=#>Danny DeVito</a>), where he makes friends with characters such as Karl the Giant (<a href=#>Matthew McGrory</a>).</p><p>One day as Edward walks under the Big Top, he becomes mesmerized by his first glimpse of Sandra, and time crawls into slo-mo as he knows immediately this is the woman he is destined to marry.</p><p>There are other adventures, one involving a catfish as big as a shark, but it would be hard to top the time he parachutes onto the stage of a Red Army talent show in China, and meets Ping and Jing, a conjoined vocal duo sharing two legs. Now surely all these stories are fevered fantasies, right? You will have to see the movie to be sure, although of course there is also the reliable theory that things are true if you believe them to be so; if it worked for Tinker Bell, maybe it will work for you.</p><p>Because Burton is the director, "Big Fish" of course is a great-looking film, with a fantastical visual style that could be called Felliniesque if Burton had not by now earned the right to the adjective Burtonesque. Yet there is no denying that Will has a point: The old man is a blowhard. There is a point at which his stories stop working as entertainment and segue into sadism. As someone who has been known to tell the same jokes more than once, I find it wise to at least tell them quickly; old Edward, on the other hand, seems to be a member of Bob and Ray's Slow Talkers of America.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46boKBllp7AqXmRaWds</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-greek-salad-dressing.html><span>←</span><span>Best Greek Salad Dressing [Taste Test]</span></a>
