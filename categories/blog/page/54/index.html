Higher-performance coolers like all-in-one liquid cooling systems have typically solved the problem. Noctua seems to have a different method of improving cooling performance without spending much on a cooler. Apparently, offsetting the CPU cooler mount by 7 mm can reduce the processor's temperature by up to&nbsp;3°C.
There are several reasons why AMD's Ryzen 7000-series processors based on the Zen 4 microarchitecture require better cooling than their predecessors.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>NXTs Chad Lail And Chris Dijak Receive New Ring Names</h2><time>Jun 1, 2024</time>

Quaid reluctantly agrees to become a subject for dream research, and almost immediately falls in love with von Sydow's assistant, the healthy and cheerful Kate Capshaw, of "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom." Then the plot thickens. Christopher Plummer turns up as the head of US "covert intelligence." He is best friends with the president (Eddie Albert), who is, needless to say, having trouble sleeping these days. Albert has nightmares about starting World War III, and Plummer has nightmares that Albert will turn into a pacifist.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/53/>← Prev Page</a>
