<a href=../../../../conway-twitty.html></a>
Some say love, it is a river
And that it drowns the tender reed
And some say love, it's like a razor
And that it leaves your soul to bleed.Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower
And you, it's only seed.
It's a heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's a dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Brawadis - Age, Family, Bio</h2><time>Jul 12, 2024</time>

What to do? Better still, how to care about an idea that might stretch to a four-minute sketch but hardly to feature length? The challenge had to be faced by director Neil Israel, whose previous credits include "Tunnelvision." That movie had a Procter and Bergman sketch in it about a charity marathon to save New York.
