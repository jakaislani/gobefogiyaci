The men faced massive racial discrimination as they served their country.</p><p>100-year-old Wilfred DeFour,&nbsp;an aircraft technician of the Tuskegee Airmen, attended the ceremony. He said at the time he and the others didn’t know they were making history, but “were just doing our job.”</p><p>“I regret so many of my comrades are no longer here with us,” said DeFour, who worked as a postal&nbsp;employee for more than 30 years after serving in the military.</p><p>Espaillat told the New York Daily News, “They were really known for breaking racial barriers in the military, and were active in fighting against Jim Crow in the South.”</p><p>He added, “It is a fitting tribute to honor their memory and contribution to this country.”</p>Korean War veteran and&nbsp;Espaillat’s predecessor, former Rep. Charles Rangel, said the&nbsp;post office honor is exactly what the country in general needed.<p>“Can you imagine our country being attacked by Japanese, Italians and Germans, and through the poison of racism and segregation a group of human beings of color have to fight for the right to defend this nation?” said Rangel. “Oh, no. We needed this.”</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX55e5BqZmtuX6OyuHnYqKmkZaCkwLV5zp%2BdopuVYr%2BmusCmnJ1lmaN6qbvNqKlmp5Ziwba%2Fyp6enp1dlrazucSnZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./greek-salad-dressing.html><span>←</span><span>Greek Salad Dressing</span></a>
