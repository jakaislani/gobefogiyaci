Meg Ryan has had an inconsistent career, with both glorious highs and worrisome lows that made some wonder whether her career would recover. However, we can say that it’s not yet Ryan’s time to retire from the industry. Recently the trailer for What Happens Later dropped, a movie about giving a past flame a second chance — at the airport no less — which has the actress both in front of and behind the camera and her fans are glad to see her return.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How long does a colostomy reversal surgery take?</h2><time>Aug 8, 2024</time>

A straightforward stoma reversal will take around 1-2 hours to perform under a general anaesthetic. How long does stoma reversal surgery take? The reversal is a small operation lasting approximately 30 to 60 minutes but still involves a general anaesthetic. You will usually be in hospital for about three to five days.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Six Batman Games Are Available To Play For Free Right Now</h2><time>Aug 8, 2024</time>

The console wars have turned digital, with the rise of competing online platforms vying for attention and exclusivity. While Steam still reigns supreme, just debuting an overhaul of their library system, the Epic Game Store is, uh, picking up steam, as it were. They already have Apex Legends and exclusivity on Control (which our very own Dylan did not like) and Borderlands 3. Now, however, to entice even more gamers to their service, Epic is offering up six Batman games for the grand price of nothing.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Slater Vance- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Ethnicity, Net Worth, Height, Career</h2><time>Aug 8, 2024</time>

Today Microsoft is announcing an updated Surface Laptop, dubbed the Surface Laptop 4, and brings the hardware up to date, somewhat at least.

Some people run at the first sign of stormy weather
Some people hold on and work it out together
I believe in you you believe in me
The rainbow ahead may be hard to see
We gotta hang on to this dream don't let go[Chorus]
No matter how hard it gets we haven't finished yet
There's so much of life ahead we got so much to do

Garrett Brown (born April 6, 1942) is an American cinematographer who is best known as the creator of the Steadicam, which was invented by him. Using Brown’s innovation, cameramen may shoot while walking without experiencing the usual shaking and jostling that comes with using a handheld camera. In 1976, the Hal Ashby film Bound for Glory won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography, and the Steadicam has since been used on films such as Rocky, where it was used to film Rocky’s running and training sequences, and Return of the Jedi, where Brown walked through a Redwood forest with a Steadicam shooting film at 1 frame per second to achieve the illusion of high speed motion during the speeder-bomb sequence.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Kale &amp;amp; Olive Oil Vegan Mashed Potatoes</h2><time>Aug 6, 2024</time>
