I don’t think so.) Larroudé — known for its really great shoes and handbags that have earned a stamp of approval from fashion editors like myself, celebrities like Dakota Johnson and Vanessa Hudgens, and even the First Lady Jill Biden — has teamed up with LoveShackFancy, another brand bolstered to fame thanks to its loyal celebrity following that includes Kelly Ripa, Jennifer Lopez, and Angelina Jolie.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/16/>← Prev Page</a>
