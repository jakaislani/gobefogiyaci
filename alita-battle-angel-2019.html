<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Alita: Battle Angel movie review (2019)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Although Alita is built with some feminist empowerment in mind, some of the messaging malfunctions against old world patriarchy. The odd paternalistic doctor is just the start. Because she looks like a teen girl, of course, she develops a heterosexual crush on a human teen boy, Hugo (<a href=#>Keean Johnson</a>). Never mind that she’s actually 300 some years older and very much a cyborg. The two share some cute moments, but others, like when Hugo introduces her to chocolate or when Alita offers Hugo her one-of-a-kind ancient technology heart so he can go up to Zalem, feel so old school. Was this all because she’s an impulsive teen girl? In another scene, after a devastating battle with a big bad cyborg, Alita must trade out the delicate, girlish body the doctor had built for his daughter (not weird—at all!) for a warrior-grade bod that adheres to her, um, vision of herself. That vision includes a corset-sized tiny waist and an athletic set of breasts that defy gravity. It’s been 300 years after the fall and we’re still holding onto Barbie-size proportions.</p><p>Thankfully, Salazar smoothes over many of these cumbersome details with her earnest motion-captured performance. She physically leans into the awkwardness of walking around as a teen girl bot, unsure of her new body and discovering its potential and limits. She explores her new surroundings with literal wide-eyed wonder. When she upgrades her body, she stands tall and confident, having sped through puberty in the span of a surgery. Her character’s chutzpah is the reason why it vaguely makes sense to jump from a “hunter killer,” a bounty hunter in futuristic terms, to a Motorball prospect when she’s working her way to becoming a warrior.</p><p>With so much background and story to cover, maybe “Alita” would have benefitted from a “less is more” approach.&nbsp;But considering its&nbsp;estimated budget of&nbsp;$200 million, “Alita: Battle Angel” is an awe-inspiring jump for the man who first burst onto the film scene with a movie that cost around $7,000. The visual bonanza cooked up by Rodriguez, cinematographer <a href=#>Bill Pope</a> and editors <a href=#>Stephen E. Rivkin</a> and <a href=#>Ian Silverstein</a> is enough to power through any narrative bumps with quickly paced action and bleak, yet colorful, imagery.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46ao6KskWKvosDTpZxmmZ6csq15kWlocg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-mary-from-90-day-fiances-tiktok.html><span>←</span><span>What is Mary from 90 Day Fiancs TikTok?</span></a>
