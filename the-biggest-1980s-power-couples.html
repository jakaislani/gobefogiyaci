He wrote his hit song "Uptown Girl" about her, though she later admitted to <a href=#>Howard Stern</a> she had no idea who he was when they first met at a party in St. Bart's with other famous faces, including Whitney Houston.

"I had no idea what I&nbsp;was getting into,"&nbsp;she said.</p><p>They divorced in 1994, but have remained close over the years. They have a daughter together, Alexa Ray Joel, who has followed in her father's musical footsteps. And of course, her parents are proud. When&nbsp;<a href=#>Social Life Magazine</a>&nbsp;asked Brinkley to name her top musicians in 2019, she replied, "Alexa, Joni Mitchell, and Billy Joel."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlmboNygI6tn55lkp60qLHSrWRqcWhlwG68zrCcq2WTpMKxuMSsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-do-you-pop-an-abscess-naturally.html><span>←</span><span>How do you pop an abscess naturally?</span></a>
