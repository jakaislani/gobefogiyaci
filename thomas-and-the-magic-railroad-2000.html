<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Thomas And The Magic Railroad movie review (2000)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Other actors are likewise adrift in the film. A few years ago, <a href=#>Alec Baldwin</a> was delivering the electrifying monologue in &nbsp;"<a href=#>Glengarry Glen Ross</a>."&nbsp;Now he is Mr. Conductor, about 12 inches tall, materializing in a cloud of sparkle dust in a geranium basket. I do not blame him for taking a role in a children's movie, not even a role 12 inches high. I do question his judgment in getting into this one.</p><p>"Thomas and the Magic Railroad'' is an inept assembly of ill-matched plot points, meandering through a production that has attractive art direction (despite the immobile mouths). Many of the frames would make cheerful stills. Thomas and his fellow trains, even Evil Diesel, have kind of a jolly energy, and I like the landscapes and trees and hamlets.</p><p>But what a lugubrious plot. What endless trips back and forth between the Isle of Sodor and the full-sized town of Shining Time. What inexplicable characters, such as Billy Twofeathers (<a href=#>Russell Means</a>), who appear and disappear senselessly. What a slow, wordy, earnest enterprise this is, when it should be quick and sprightly.</p><p>That "Thomas and the Magic Railroad'' made it into theaters at all is something of a mystery. This is a production with "straight to video'' written all over it. Kids who like the Thomas books might might kinda like it.</p><p>Especially younger kids. Real younger kids. Otherwise, no.</p><p>Perhaps the success of the Harry Potter books has inspired hope that Thomas, also a British children's icon, will do some business. Not a chance. In an age when even the cheapest Saturday morning cartoons find a way to make the lips move, what, oh, what, was the reasoning behind Thomas' painted-on grin?&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn6ilkah6orrDZquhnV2irqi1wmapmqGcp7yisIxrZ2lo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stephen-hawking-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Stephen Hawking Net Worth 2024</span></a>
