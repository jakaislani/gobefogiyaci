Unfortunately, he’ll be taken away to Baldur’s Gate before you can rescue him, but this also means you don’t need to worry about bringing Wyll along for this leg of your journey, or changing Ravengard’s fate somehow.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Wyrm.27s_Crossing data-transform=header>Wyrm's Crossing</span></h2><p>This is the first region of Act 3, and it's technically the first area of Baldur's Gate (the city, not the game). As you approach the northern region of Wyrm's Crossing, you'll hear about Lord Gortash's coronation. Once you reach Wyrm's Rock Fortress, and head upstairs to the ceremony, you'll see the Grand Duke Ravengard as part of the coronation.</p><p><img decoding=async alt=WyllCompQuest-Wyll3Mizora.png src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/baldurs-gate-3/c/cf/WyllCompQuest-Wyll3Mizora.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Mizora is also in the area, and you can speak to her, where she'll tell you to attend the ceremony, and that she'll have a talk with you after. Speaking to Grand Duke Ravengard is a fruitless endeavor, since he's been infected with an illithid tadpole at Moonrise Towers.</p><p>Speaking to Mizora afterwards, on the road north out of Wyrm's Rock, reveals that Ravengard has disappeared after the ceremony. That's all she has to say for now, but she promises to visit your camp the next time you rest to speak further.</p><p>Once you rest, Mizora will visit your camp to propose a new deal. She will give you Ravengard's location and protect him from harm, but only if Wyll forges an eternal contract with her. The alternative is that Wyll can break his contract immediately, but his father will likely die without her help. Whatever your choice, Wyll keeps his powers for the time being, to pay the Absolute back for imprisoning Mizora. If Wyll chooses to break the contract, he is resigned to his father's death, but there may still be a chance to save him.</p><p><img decoding=async alt=SaveGondians-Start.png src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/baldurs-gate-3/2/2a/SaveGondians-Start.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>That chance comes in the form of a submarine beneath the Grey Harbour. Follow the side quest “<a class="jsx-955973305 external text underlined" href=#>Avenge the Drowned</a>” to discover The Iron Throne, an underwater prison full of Gortash’s enemies. Our guide to saving Ravengard can come in very handy, but afterwards he’ll have another important duty for you.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Waking_The_Wyrm data-transform=header>Waking The Wyrm</span></h2><p><img decoding=async alt=WyllCompQuest-Wyll3Duke.png src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/baldurs-gate-3/2/20/WyllCompQuest-Wyll3Duke.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>After making amends with Wyll, Ravengard entrusts a book to you which describes a dragon that sleeps beneath the city. It promised to help mankind exactly one time, and Ravengard believes this is the time to call for its aid. To start this task, you must return to the Wyrm’s Rock fortress prison, where Counsellor Florrick was unjustly imprisoned. You likely no longer have direct access to the fortress, so you may need to teleport to South Span Checkpoint, and use feather fall to jump down to the cliffs on the south face of the fortress, then enter the prison using the cracked wall on the east side.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrPNZ5qopV%2Bstqy10miZmqSUqr%2B0ecaaq55lY2SkurjLc5aNoJWUj62tw56WqJ6Pe7%2BwutOinKur</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ways-to-meet-millionaires-online-and-in-person.html><span>←</span><span>Ways to Meet Millionaires Online and in Person</span></a>
