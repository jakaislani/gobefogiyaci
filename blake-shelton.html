His style was a traditional mix of blue-collar rock songs and country ballads, and he soon topped the country music charts with the song "Austin," which held the No. 1 spot for five weeks. In 2002 he hit the charts with his self-titled debut album — released by Warner Bros. once Giant Records dissolved — and the singles "All Over Me" and "Ol' Red" helped the album achieve gold status.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Dreamer,' 'Pure BS'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In February 2003, Shelton released The Dreamer, and its first single, "The Baby," reached No. 1 on the country music charts, hanging on for three weeks.
