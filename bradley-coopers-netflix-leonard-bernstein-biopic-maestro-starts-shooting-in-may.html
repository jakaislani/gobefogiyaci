It’s clear by the passion he shares for music that the project is very important to him. He even asked Santa Claus for a baton as a child.</p><p>“I wanted to be a conductor since I was a kid. I was obsessed with it, asked Santa Claus for a baton when I was 8. Listening to music, falling in love with it and being able to really know every single moment of a piece, like Tchaikovsky’s ‘Opus 35’ in D major, this violin concerto. I could do it as if I know everything about it without really being able to speak the language, obviously.”</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>Maestro tells the story of Leonard Bernstein — conductor, composer, and humanitarian who was world-renowned for his immense talent and skillful dedication to his craft. In addition to his love of music, Bernstein had a passion for people and raised money/awareness for several initiatives.</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=466 data-injectable=true>How did Cooper become the director for Maestro? He discussed Spielberg’s initial role as director of the film and how a conversation led to Cooper taking on that role.</p><p>“I told Spielberg, ‘I always felt like I could play a conductor, but may I research the material and see if I can write it and direct it? Would you let me do that? Steven has a lot of interests — he’ll just choose one thing and all of the other things will be on hold. I think he knew he wasn’t going to make that movie for a while. He was kind enough to hand it off to me, and that’s what I’ve been doing for the last four and a half years, and we start shooting in May.”</p><p data-characters=190 data-current-count=190 data-injectable=false>Cooper received three Academy Award nominations for his directorial debut, A Star Is Born, and fans can’t wait to see what he brings to the table as both director and star of Maestro.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomauZlKGyunnCqKapnaKoeq%2Bx05%2BjorBdobKwusCrm2aalae7tMDEoqVmmpmkvaqvjKaYnqukp7xuv9Oaqa2rXai1sLvToqWgZZmjeq6t2Gg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vic-johnson-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Vic Johnson Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
