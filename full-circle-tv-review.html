<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Full Circle movie review &amp;amp; film summary ()</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>“Full Circle” opens as what seems like a relatively straightforward kidnapping drama, almost as if it will be Soderbergh’s take on something like <a href=#>Ron Howard</a>’s&nbsp;“<a href=#>Ransom</a>.” The son of a wealthy family is kidnapped. Except, well, not really. Things go very wrong from the beginning of this complex scheme, orchestrated by Guyanese power player Mahabir (<a href=#>CCH Pounder</a>), who speaks of closing a circle to remove a curse. You see, the powerful New York family has ties to an incident in Guyana many years ago, and so the kidnapping is more than just a typical money grab—it’s an act of vengeance. Much of the most interesting material in Solomon’s script&nbsp;works from the idea that people often act out of more than one self-interest.</p><p>At first, Derek (<a href=#>Timothy Olyphant</a>) and Sam (<a href=#>Claire Danes</a>) presume that the abduction of their son Jared (<a href=#>Ethan Stoddard</a>) is purely for financial gain. After all, Jared's grandfather is a celebrity named Chef Jeff (<a href=#>Dennis Quaid</a>). The abductors, which include Mahabir’s nephew Aked (<a href=#>Jharrel Jerome</a>), his ex-girlfriend Natalia (Adia), and teens named Xavier (<a href=#>Sheyi Cole</a>) and Louis (Gerald Jones), demand an odd sum: $314,159, which Jeff notes is the start of the numerical value of pi. It’s an easy amount of money for this incredibly well-off family to get, and Derek is soon racing around town with a bag of cash. However, something’s gone wrong from the very beginning that I won’t spoil. I’ll only say that decisions must be made quickly, and not everyone here seems capable of making the right ones.</p><p>Dragged into this drama is an officer of the United States Postal Inspection Service named Harmony (<a href=#>Zazie Beetz</a>), who is investigating a series of insurance scams perpetrated by Mahabir and her crew. When she’s not butting heads with a slimy superior Manny, played perfectly by <a href=#>Jim Gaffigan</a>, or breaking up with her girlfriend, the spectacularly named Melody Harmony is playing Columbo, drawing the lines that connect Mahabir, Aked, Sam & Derek, and even her boss. It’s a tale of remarkable connections between characters that sometimes stretches credulity, but the robustness of Soderbergh’s filmmaking holds it together. Whether it’s sweaty close-ups or liberal use of&nbsp;a very Bernard Herrmann-esque score by <a href=#>Zack Ryan</a>, "Full Circle" is a great example of how much craftsmanship one of the best American filmmakers brings to everything he does.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46frKWkXZi2s6%2FLnmStrl2nsre1xLA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./edamame-corn-succotash.html><span>←</span><span>Edamame &amp;amp; Corn Succotash</span></a>
