Well, the contemporary crime movie does thrive on sound and fury, and these days what it signifies is largely a matter of diminishing returns, alas.

If you go to a bookstore looking for Markus Zusak's novel, the movie's source, you're likely be directed to the Young Adult or Teen Fiction sections, which explains a lot about the movie's appeal, and lack thereof. Like a kid-friendly mulch of elements cribbed from "The Diary of Anne Frank" and "Slaughterhouse-Five," the film conceivably could play well to an audience of 12-year-olds and their grandparents. Other adults, though, are more apt to find the proceedings an occasion for fits of squirming and eye-rolling.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Where Is Elizabeth Smart Today?</h2><time>May 14, 2024</time>
