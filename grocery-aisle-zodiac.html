Nowhere, that’s where. Similarly, where else can you find two very different personality traits in one very chaotic human? Nowhere but Gemini town, baybee!

Oh, she’s changed. All that is to say, Cancers will surprise you. They are giving “dairy section” upon first impression, but by the end of your first discussion, they have graduated to those travel-sized Tillamook cheese squares and you will never look back. Keep your Cancer friends around always. And also travel-sized Tillamooks.</p><p><strong>Read our rankings of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-cheese/>best cheese</a> and the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-yogurt/>best yogurt</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Leo (July 23-August 22):</strong> Produce</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ZODIAC_GROCERY-SECTION_ARTICLE_LEO-1170x658.jpg><p>Hear me out: The produce section is the most vibrant, varied, expensive, and visually stunning part of the store. It’s often the first part of the store you hit when you walk in. Similarly, Leos often fancy themselves “vibrant, varied, and expensive,” and hey, most of the time they are right. Leos are a whole different vibe from the rest of this crazy grocery store that we call life, and I respect the hustle.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Virgo (August 23-September 22):</strong> <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/aisle/pantry-bread/>Cereal and Granola Bars</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ZODIAC_GROCERY-SECTION_ARTICLE_VIRGO-1170x658.jpg><p>Virgos are organized. They like things to make logical sense and for related items in a store to be placed together. That said, welcome, Virgos, to the one-stop shop for all things breakfast, not to mention beautifully organized rows of colorful cereal boxes to whet your appetite for order. Plus, Virgos are always busy and this aisle usually has <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-instant-oatmeal/>instant oatmeal</a> in it, too.

Spices make balance happen. I hold that Avatar Aang wouldn’t have (spoilers) defeated the Firelord and restored balance to the world without spices.

What exactly is in those weird middle aisles of the grocery store. They have everything Target has somehow and, yet, you would never even know any of it was there if you didn’t look. Turns out most grocery stores have more than just groceries and it took me the better part of a quarter century to figure that out. Similarly, I’m still figuring out Scorpios, too.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Sagittarius (November 22-December 21):</strong> <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/aisle/deli-dairy/>Deli</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ZODIAC_GROCERY-SECTION_ARTICLE_SAG-1170x658.jpg><p>The deli is where they keep all of the cool cheese. The ones you put on your charcuterie boards. The ones that make your friends say, “You spent WHAT on cheese?” But that also means there are a bunch of weird, cool, and interesting cheeses and meats to try. As the most curious and knowledge-seeking of the signs, Sagittarians can go to the deli section to choose their own adventure and try something new.</p><p><strong>Read our rankings of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-cheddar-cheese/>best cheddar cheese</a> and the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-turkey/>best deli turkey&nbsp;</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Capricorn (December 22-January 19):</strong> Checkout Line Shelves</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ZODIAC_GROCERY-SECTION_ARTICLE_CAP-1170x658.jpg><p>Need gum? Well, you kind of have to wait until the end of your grocery trip to get it because, guess what? It is only by the checkout, along with Mentos, two or three flavors of Altoids, and at least five other shoppers because only one lane is open for some reason. But if you are like me and you always forget the things at the end of your grocery trip, you probably aren’t a Capricorn. They have the patience and maturity to wait the whole trip and then remember at the end to grab what they need. Let’s face it, Capricorns, like Miss Taylor Swift, are mother.</p><p><strong>Read our ranking of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-candy-bars/>best candy bars</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Aquarius (January 20-February 18):</strong> Eggs</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ZODIAC_GROCERY-SECTION_ARTICLE_AQUA-1170x658.jpg><p>Name any other section of the grocery store that compares, I’ll wait…</p><p>See? You can’t. Eggs are iconic. Eggs are not like the other girls and they know it. Eggs are game changers. Also and perhaps most importantly, I love eggs. I am an Aquarius.

You can traipse through with your s/o like the main character of an indie movie, grab a jar of PB and a jar of jelly while walking backwards and say, “Look babe, we go together like these two jars of food!” Or if your s/o is allergic to PB, you can sub in the “jam and bread” combo—it works just as well.
