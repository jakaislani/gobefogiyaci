Speaking up against oppression against Black people when there were far fewer voices echoing yours meant you were always a target, like Harry and Harriette Moore, a married couple from Florida who counted themselves among the loudest voices of the early 1950s.</p><p>At home in Mims, Florida, to celebrate Christmas on December 25, 1951, the Moores didn't expect anything unusual. Of course, that's when the worst things tend to happen. It was not only Christmas, but also their 25th wedding anniversary, and they celebrated with their young daughter. But tragedy struck that night. A bomb placed under the floorboards of their home detonated, killing both Harry and Harriette, but sparing their daughter, who was in another part of the house when the bomb exploded, according to <a href=#>History</a>.</p><p>Who would be so cruel as to commit a terrorist act on Christmas? <a href=#>The Ku Klux Klan</a>, of course, hoping to silence the Moores. It wasn't even a mystery. Police figured it out pretty quickly, but, unfortunately, were unable to arrest the perpetrators before their deaths. Two of the suspects died of natural causes within a year, while a third committed suicide after being interviewed twice by the FBI. The Klan made a big mistake, though — killing the Moores only empowered the Civil Rights movement, lighting a fire under the cause and spawning numerous protests and nationwide anger toward the murderers.</p><p>If you or a loved one has experienced a hate crime, contact the VictimConnect Hotline by phone at 1-855-4-VICTIM or <a href=#>by chat</a> for more information or assistance in locating services to help.
