And while the horror feature technically fit within the timeframe of Oscars submissions before the Nov. 15 cutoff, it seems incredibly silly to believe that Curtis would win an Academy Award for the legacy sequel ‚Äî especially when you consider its <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">less-than-favorable reviews</a>.</p><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=192 data-injectable=false>But if this series of tweets is of any indication, then it‚Äôs quite clear that a strong majority of folks truly did believe that Curtis won an Oscar for her intense battle with Michael Myers:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>I will never forgive the Oscars for making me believe for a split second that Jamie Lee Curtis won an Oscar for Halloween Ends (I hadn‚Äôt looked at the nominees and know nothing about last night)</p>‚Äî Plagued by Visions (@PlaguedVisions) <a href=#>March 13, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I‚Äôm laughing so hard I thought the reason everyone was mad at Jamie Lee Curtis was because she won the Oscar for her being in Halloween Ends</p>‚Äî miss chad (@m1sschad) <a href=#>March 13, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Pretending that Jamie Lee Curtis Oscar is for Halloween Ends</p>‚Äî Christian (@ThatBlurayGuy) <a href=#>March 13, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>the academy secretly wanted to give jamie lee curtis the award for her role in halloween ends but because of their anti-horror bias decided to let her have it for everything everywhere all at once. i know the truth</p>‚Äî üî™ audra/quinn‚ùì (@carouselshotgun) <a href=#>March 13, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=693 data-injectable=false>Then again, when you consider the fact that Curtis has portrayed fan-favorite horror character Laurie Strode since the ‚Äò70s, it actually makes sense as to why the renowned scream queen should have won an Oscar decades ago.
