In addition to its extensive film production work, Kartemquin has been an incubator for young talent, running innovative media arts community programs, including the acclaimed Diverse Voices in Docs mentorship program and the KTQ Labs, acting as a resource for the local and national media communities.</p><p>“Anyone who cares about the future must ensure we are listening to the generation of leaders to whom it belongs,” said Kartemquin’s board of directors Chair&nbsp;Sylvia Ewing. “Amir brings a deep love for documentary, comprehensive knowledge of cinema past and present and the collaborative spirit to navigate new partnerships and collaborations in the region and internationally. Amir is a quiet and beloved force, much like our co-founder Gordon Quinn. We are well-positioned to bring our staff’s ambitious goals to life in partnership with our community of filmmakers and supporters.”</p><p>Kartemquin will celebrate the extraordinary career of Gordon Quinn and the exciting future of Kartemquin at "A Roast and a Toast" on Monday, December 5th, 2022, at Billboard Showroom in Ravenswood, Chicago.
