But he was sure to write “healthy daughter” here. Chris Pratt is a scumbag.</p><p>On Thursday, Pratt, who is 42 years old, wrote a birthday post for his wife that was six weeks early and included the controversial comment.</p><p>He wrote in the caption of a photo of him and Schwarzenegger, 31, “She’s given me an incredible life, a beautiful healthy daughter, and she chews so noisily that sometimes I have to put my earbuds in to drown it out, but that’s love!”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/chris-pratt-controversy-daughter-1-1024x529.jpg alt="chris pratt controversy daughter" width=696 height=359 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>As was said, Pratt’s son Jack, who is now 9, was born early and had to have many surgeries because of it. He was born weighing only 3 pounds and 12 ounces.</p><p>“It was a big surprise when Jack was born two months early. And all of a sudden, your whole world changes,” Faris, who is 44 years old, said in 2018 on her podcast “Unqualified.” “Jack had several operations. He’s had a few surgeries for hernias, a few for his eyes, and a small heart problem.</p><p>At a March of Dimes Celebration of Babies event in 2014, Pratt also talked about his son’s early struggles.</p><p><span style=font-size:24pt>“I made promises about what kind of dad I wanted to be at that moment, and I just prayed that he’d live long enough so I could keep them.”&nbsp;</span></p><p>“Our Jack went from being a small, helpless baby to a strong, smart, happy, funny, handsome boy who loves monster trucks, “Daniel Tiger,” and, believe it or not, vegetables. His favorite foods are broccoli and cherry tomatoes.”</p><p>In 2018, when Jack was six years old, Pratt and Faris got a divorce. Then, in June 2019, the “Tomorrow War” star wedded Schwarzenegger. In August 2020, they had their first child, a baby girl named Lyla Maria.&nbsp; Page Six asked Pratt and Faris’s reps for a comment, but they didn’t get back to us right away.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLyvwNGorZ6qo658pLTRoqpmqKKWwbV5wqilraqfq7Kzv9hoaGxoZ2x8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bryshere-gray-net-worth-132336.html><span>←</span><span>Bryshere Gray Net Worth</span></a>
