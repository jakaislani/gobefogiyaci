She had two sisters. They are also late. Her father was known to be a businessman while her mother was a homemaker.</p><p>Her parents had two more daughters; one died before Louise was born and the other, Tereze who was born in 1945 and died in 2018 w as a vice president at Citibank and a published author whose novel, May You Live in Interesting Times, won the Iowa Short Fiction Award in 1995.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Louise Glück career</h2><p>Glück started writing poetry and attended poetry seminars. Her first piece was published in Mademoiselle, and shortly after that, poetry by her was included in Poetry, The New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly, The Nation, and other publications.</p><p>Glück worked as a secretary to support herself after leaving Columbia. In 1967, she wed Charles Hertz Jr. Glück’s first book of poems, Firstborn, which&nbsp;was released in 1968 and got some favorable reviews. The poet Robert Hass characterized the work as “hard, artful, and full of pain” in a review.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/14115230/download-5-2-1024x538.jpeg><p>After the book was released, Glück suffered from a protracted case of writer’s block. According to her, this condition was only resolved after 1971, when she started teaching poetry at Goddard College in Vermont.</p><p>Her second book, The House on Marshland (1975), which many reviewers have hailed as her breakthrough work, contained the poetry she composed during this period and marked the “discovery of a distinctive voice.”</p><p>Glück gave birth to a son in 1973. Following the dissolution of her marriage to Charles Hertz Jr., she wed John Dranow, a writer who had founded Goddard College’s summer writing program, in 1977.</p><p>Dranow and Francis Voigt, the poet Ellen Bryant Voigt’s spouse, collaborated to found the New England Culinary Institute in 1980. Early financiers in the institute who also served on its board of directors were Glück and Bryant Voigt.</p><p>As a distinguished lecturer in the English Department, Glück joined the faculty at Williams College in Massachusetts in 1984. Her father passed away the following year.</p><p>Her latest book of poetry, Ararat (1990), which takes its name from the mountain mentioned in the Genesis flood story, was inspired by the loss.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The Wild Iris (1992), one of Glück’s best-known and most highly regarded books, portrays garden flowers conversing with a gardener and a divinity about the nature of life. This book came after this collection.</p><p>This “important book” with “poetry of great beauty” was hailed by Publishers Weekly. It was referred to as “a milestone work” by critic Elizabeth Lund in a piece for The Christian Science Monitor. The subsequent Pulitzer Prize triumph in 1993 solidified Glück’s standing as a leading American poet.</p><p>In 2004, Glück released a chapbook named October in response to the September 11 terrorist attacks. It is a single poem separated into six sections that explore many facets of trauma and pain. She was appointed the Rosenkranz Writer in Residence at Yale University in the same year.</p><p>Glück continued to publish poems even after he joined the Yale faculty. Her works Averno (2006), A Village Life (2009), and Faithful and Virtuous Night (2014) were all released at this time.</p><p>poetry: 1962-2012, a compilation of her poetry spanning a half-century, was released in 2012, and it was hailed as “a literary event”. 2017 saw the release of American Originality, another collection of her articles.</p><p>Glück received the Nobel Prize in Literature in October 2020, making her the sixteenth woman to receive the honor since it was established in 1901.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/14115202/148869-eovzpzdrfq-1602161800-1024x538.jpg><p>She collected her reward at her house because of COVID-19 pandemic-related limitations. She emphasized her early reading of poetry by William Blake and Emily Dickinson in her Nobel lecture, which she gave in writing while talking about the connection between poets, readers, and the general public.</p><p>Winter Recipes from the Collective, Glück’s compilation, was published in 2021. She was appointed Yale’s Frederick Iseman Professor of Poetry Practice in 2022.</p><p>She began working as an English professor at Stanford University in 2023, where she instructed students in the creative writing program.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>www.Ghgosip.com</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqWmrqGjmnqouNScomaokaeyr8DSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katie-rost-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Katie Rost Net Worth - Pulptastic</span></a>
