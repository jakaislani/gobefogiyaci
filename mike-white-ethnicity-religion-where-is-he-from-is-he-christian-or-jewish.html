Is He Christian Or Jewish?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>This page discusses Miami Dolphins quarterback <strong>Mike White’s religion, ethnicity</strong>, and familial relationships.<strong> Is he a Christian or a Jew?&nbsp;</strong>Miami Dolphins quarterback Mike White has recently made headlines for his outstanding performance on the field. In Week 13, he led his team to a 45-15 victory against the Commanders, completing his lone pass attempt for three yards while playing the last 13 plays.&nbsp;He also helped the Dolphins win the AFC’s top seed, giving them a legitimate Super Bowl candidate. But who is Mike White outside of football? What are his religion, family history, and ethnicity? Here are some facts about the rising talent that you may not be aware of.</p><h2>Mike White Religion: Is the Miami Dolphins quarterback Jewish or Christian?</h2><p><strong>Mike White’s religion</strong> is one of the most often asked subjects among fans. Is he a Christian or a Jew? White has not publicly expressed his religion or views, therefore the answer is ambiguous. However, certain hints point to his being Christian. For one example, he took part in the “My Cause, My Cleats” program, in which NFL players wear bespoke cleats to promote causes that are important to them.&nbsp;White-backed “The Salvation Army,” a Christian philanthropic organization that assists the poor. He also has a tattoo on his left arm that says “Philippians 4:13,” which is a Bible phrase that means, “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” On the other hand, based on his surname and looks, some fans believe White is Jewish.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Mike-White-4.jpg alt="Mike White" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>However, there is no evidence to corroborate this assertion since White’s ancestors are mostly English, with little degrees of Swedish, Norwegian, German, and Cornish.&nbsp;His surname might have come from a nickname for someone with pale complexion or hair, or an Old English place name meaning “white.”&nbsp;Furthermore, White’s father is James Melville “Mel” White, a longtime speechwriter and copywriter for Religious Right heavyweights like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, both of whom are notorious for their anti-Semitic language and attitudes.&nbsp;Mel White subsequently came out as homosexual and divorced his wife, Lyla Lee Loehr, a fundraising expert and former Pasadena Playhouse executive director.</p><p>In addition, he formed the gay-rights group “Soulforce” and became a champion for LGBTQ+ Christians.&nbsp;As a result, Mike White is most likely a Christian who is not linked with any particular religion or church.&nbsp;He could also have a more liberal and inclusive perspective of Christianity than his father’s previous employers.</p><h2>Mike White’s Ethnicity and Origin</h2><p><strong>Mike White</strong> was born on March 25, 1995, in Pembroke Pines, Florida. Mel and Lyla White, his parents, split when he was young. Alex and Molly are his two elder siblings. He was raised in a conventional and strictly religious home with no ties to the entertainment industry.&nbsp;However, he has always enjoyed writing and athletics. He attended Nova Southeastern University’s University School in Davie, Florida, where he played football and basketball.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Mike-White-5.jpg alt="Mike White" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>As a senior, he was voted Florida Class 3A Player of the Year after passing for 2,201 yards and 22 touchdowns. White subsequently played two years of collegiate football at South Florida before moving to Western Kentucky for his last two seasons.&nbsp;He was picked in the fifth round of the 2018 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys, however, he was released before the start of the regular season.&nbsp;He later joined as a practice squad member with the New York Jets until being released in March 2023. On March 16, 2023, he signed as an unrestricted free agent with the Miami Dolphins.&nbsp;White is mostly white, descended from numerous European nations like England, Sweden, Norway, Germany, and Cornwall.</p><p>His paternal grandmother was called Betty Jean Red Cloud, therefore he may have Native American blood. However, no government sources have yet to corroborate this.&nbsp;White is proud of his family and ancestry, and he often shares photos of them on social media.&nbsp;He also praises them for encouraging him to achieve his aspirations and supporting him throughout his career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikoqOVYsSptdOeZJ6smKO2pLXTsmSrnZyetKq7zWauoZ2imnqqv4yhnGaeoqS6brXSZp%2BeZZOdv6q%2F06KYp2Wfp3qrsdaiqqFn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-old-is-shaquem-griffin-age-wiki-biography-height-salary-girlfriend-html.html><span>←</span><span>How Old is Shaquem Griffin?
