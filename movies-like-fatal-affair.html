Whatever the case may be, monogamy, by its very definition being about a rule, ends up causing tons of drama in people’s lives. Just think of how much your own life is dictated by monogamy and you’d know what we are talking about. Well, filmmakers do not need to think too deeply in order to catch this potential conflict point. Out of the many movies on infidelity, ‘Fatal Affair’ is one that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats with a thriller premise.</p><p>The film revolves around a wealthy woman who gets married to a man she loves. However, when their marriage is undergoing a dry phase, she ends up having an affair with one of her exes. However, her ex becomes obsessed with her, to a dangerous degree. The character of the central woman is played by <a href=#>Nia Long</a>. The role of her former lover, on the other hand, is essayed by Omar Epps of ‘<a href=#>House MD</a>‘ fame. Other cast members include Stephen Bishop, KJ Smith, Carolyn Hennest, and Maya Stojan. Here’s the list of similar movies that you must see if you liked Fatal Affair. You can most of these movies on Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>7.

The film, like ‘Fatal Affair’ is focused on a couple that audiences might think is perfect. However, the conflict begins when the husband, David misses his flight and birthday party. His wife, Catherine’s delusional jealousy soon comes to the fore because of that. She hires an escort named Chloe to test her husband’s loyalty.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>6.

It has detectable moments of highs and lows and often loses focus from the plot. However, when it is good, the movie is&nbsp;quite disturbing. It is disturbing because it painfully examines sexual and emotional tension beyond the confines of monogamy. The story revolves around…drum roll…an extramarital affair. However, there is obviously more to it than just that.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>5.

That itself should be enough to convince anyone of its quality. The movie is based on the novella, ‘Traumnovelle’ and revolves around a man who becomes obsessed with having an extra-marital affair. Soon, he joins an underground society and realizes his obsession. The movie stars<a href=#> Tom Cruise</a> and <a href=#>Nicole Kidman</a> and brilliantly touches upon themes of infidelity, love, and sexual desire.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>4.

The film does not let your attention waiver even for a split second. It revolves around a married couple after the wife mysteriously disappears. ‘Gone Girl’ makes one swing and unable to decide who to be sympathetic for throughout, keeping one guessing till the very end. <a href=#>Rosamund Pike</a> gives one of the most memorable performances of her career in this movie.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>2.
