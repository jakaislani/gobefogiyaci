Walsh’s novel, this comedy drama centers on Dusty (O’Dowd) and Cass (Dennis), who live out their quiet life in suburban Deerfield; a place populated by people who are seemingly content with their lot in life, until something turns up in the local store capable of predicting their future. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=807 data-injectable=true>Similar in certain respects to Prime Video’s Tales from the Loop, The Big Door Prize explores some expansive questions, yet keeps its focus on character. It is also reminiscent of The Box&nbsp;starring Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, which itself linked back into larger philosophical questions regarding individual choice, a route The Big Door Prize takes in a roundabout manner, as matters of destiny and potential are brought into play. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>When the Morpho machine materializes from nowhere and begins to pump out personal prophecies, everyone in this small town begins to change. Some suddenly find meaning, regain their purpose, or embrace epiphanies as they find themselves with a new lease of life. Meanwhile, others embark on ill-advised escapades as they misconstrue the meaning behind those little blue cards. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=704 data-injectable=true>However, something else happens as each person is influenced and their perspectives expanded. Local opinions are changed, new relationships are forged, and destinies are altered forever, making The Big Door Prize philosophically challenging yet&nbsp;character-driven enough to keep mainstream audiences entertained. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>As this adaptation comes from the creator of Schitt’s Creek, quirky characterization and whip-smart dialogue moments are to be expected, while David West Read ensures that Deerfield remains realistic – even if it does embrace cliché from time to time. Meaning that quiet introverted people suddenly revel in being the center of attention, while the downtrodden and dissatisfied members of this community morph into invigorated individuals. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=423 data-current-count=423 data-injectable=true>Aside from that, The Big Door Prize is relatively conventional when it comes to story, as Dusty finds himself incapable of change – even after he gets his prediction. A fact which begins driving a wedge between himself and wife Cass. As a teacher and world class whistler, it would appear that Dusty has found his niche in life, while Cass becomes increasingly disillusioned following her slice of fortune telling. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>At just over 30 minutes per episode, it never outstays its welcome, as punchy pieces of narrative are consistently doled out, giving audiences an insight into each character systematically; an approach which not only varies the perspective throughout this series, but also manages to keep things feeling fresh even once the world becomes familiar. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=685 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately, The Big Door Prize never really feels dynamic or original, despite the best efforts of all concerned. It may attempt to discuss some intangible topics connected more to the human condition, than any type of comedy narrative, but never leaves a long-lasting impression, even after two hours of television.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>However, that lack of originality never impacts on the performances from an ensemble cast, who do their best to flesh out this slice of small-town Americana. Both O’Dowd and Dennis work hard to bring the conflicts of family life into being as central protagonists, while Sammy Fourlas gives grieving underdog Jacob some real heart and soul. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=453 data-current-count=802 data-injectable=true>In truth, that particular plot line might smack of cliché, dealing as it does with fractured relationships, parental loss, and its aftermath – but nonetheless ties back into the preoccupations of potential over pre-ordained destiny this show is trying to discuss. Noy only teeing up a revelatory moment where Jacob finally comes into his own, but also granting him salvation through companionship with Dusty’s daughter Trina (Djouliet Amora).&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>There is so much more this show tries to grasp in its minimal running time, and as a whole The Big Door Prize delivers some admirable drama. O’Dowd may have come to prominence through Graham Linehan’s IT Crowd, before hitting paydirt with the small screen version of Get Shorty, but his affable everyman act feels just a tad lightweight here. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=false>Whether that has to do with the material itself is up for debate, but irrespective of those whys and wherefores – The Big Door Prize ultimately falls short of greatness. &nbsp;</p><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star-empty></span><span class=icon-star-empty></span><h5 class=review-rating>Fair</h5><p class=review-summary>Coming from the creator of 'Schitt’s Creek,' 'The Big Door Prize'promises great things.
