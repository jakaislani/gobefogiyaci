I love the quiet, gentle unfurling of the wrapper, the toothsome and savory texture of the square fruit chew, and the flavor, my god, the flavor. Starbursts legitimately burst in your mouth, deluging your taste buds with tantalizing fruitiness. I think this intense, flavorsome effect is what separates Starburst from the rest of the candy aisle offerings. Other fruit chews just can’t compare.</p><p>This extraordinary, mouth-watering fruitiness is ripe for experimentation; they’ve only scratched the surface of its delicious possibilities. So far, the brand’s attempts to branch out have been rather predictable. Tropical, sour, and FavREDS Starburst all taste great, but they’re too formulaic. Where’s the passion? No, not the passion fruit. The passion: Where’s the joy, dedication, excitement, and innovation? Starburst could reach amazing new heights by rolling out new flavors, so let’s mix it up. Here are some Starburst combinations that I’ve been dreaming up and drooling over.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cocktail>Cocktail</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/5-STARBURST-FLAVORS_DANNY-PALUMBO_SPORKED_INSET_01.jpg><p>I generally prefer the opposite of a mocktail (that is, I like my cocktails full of booze) but I still love the idea of a non-alcoholic cocktail-inspired Starburst flavor pack. A fruit chew flavored like a lime and maraschino cherry daiquiri would be refreshing and light. You could make a ginger and lime Starburst flavored like a Moscow Mule. A virgin bloody mary might be divisive as a fruit chew, but this is exactly the type of brave innovation that other companies are experimenting with right now. Mocktail Starbursts would inspire a lot of curiosity, and, these days, curiosity sells (see: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taco Truck-flavored jelly beans</a>). The possibilities here are endless.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mexican-candy>Mexican Candy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/5-STARBURST-FLAVORS_DANNY-PALUMBO_SPORKED_INSET_02.jpg><p>Starburst fruit chews, in all their juicy glory, are the perfect vessel for flavors associated with Mexican candy. Lime, chile, and tamarind immediately come to mind. Bright boldness and citrusy heat are what Mexican candy does so well. Take these <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">chili-covered mango lollipops </a>and make ’em into fruit chews. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lime and salt </a>taste great together, duh, and so do the tart and refreshing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pulparindo</a> tamarind watermelon chews. Partner with these companies (don’t just steal from them), and make it happen, Starburst.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-arizona-tea>Arizona Tea</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/5-STARBURST-FLAVORS_DANNY-PALUMBO_SPORKED_INSET_03.jpg><p>My coworkers weren’t thrilled with these , but I loved them. I thought the sweet and earthy Arizona tea flavor was beautifully infused into the fruit snacks, and I’d love to see this same concept applied to Starburst. Pair these together and you’d get to enjoy that sugary, grassy tea flavor in a juicy-as-hell Starburst. Tea has such a pleasant aroma.&nbsp; And I believe Starburst fruit chews would be a much better vessel for that tea flavor than fruit snacks. Whereas gummy candy flavor kind of dissipates, Starbursts fill your entire mouth with flavor. This is a match made in heaven. Damn, I should be rich.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-blood-orange>Blood Orange</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/5-STARBURST-FLAVORS_DANNY-PALUMBO_SPORKED_INSET_04.jpg><p>Blood orange is probably my favorite flavor of anything. It’s dazzling. This <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">A’Siciliana</a> blood orange soda is my preferred carbonated beverage and my go-to drink of choice with a nice Italian hoagie. Blood orange flavor is just so pointedly citrusy and sweet, with some tart notes that really highlight the taste And the deep red color associated with blood orange is inviting, especially on a hot day. A solid red pack of blood orange Starburst could be the flavor of the summer, if Starburst makes some moves.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-chocolate-and-fruit>Chocolate and Fruit</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/5-STARBURST-FLAVORS_DANNY-PALUMBO_SPORKED_INSET_05.jpg><p>Chocolate and fruit is a wonderful combination when executed properly. A chocolate-covered strawberry, for example, is both lavish and refreshing. Orange and chocolate work together as a formidably fragrant team, and chocolate cherries are wonderfully sharp and sweet. You can even mix in some white chocolate with fruits it pairs best with, like blueberries, blackberries, and peaches. One thing I know for sure: Chocolate Starburst chews wouldn’t work on their own, but they would absolutely taste amazing if paired with the right fruit flavors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKaVrHq0wMCrma6qo6l6p7jAr6arq12ssm7DwKeraA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./choosing-a-gaming-cpu-at-1440p-adding-in-haswell.html><span>←</span><span>CPUs, GPUs, Motherboards, and Memory</span></a>
