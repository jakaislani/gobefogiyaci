<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Who Is Sizwe Dhlomo? Relationship &amp;amp; Career Explored</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Sizwe Dhlomo</strong> is a 39-year-old media personality and farmer who works as an MTV Base VJ and anchors Kaya drive on Kaya FM. Isaac Dhlomo, a rich South African farmer, is his grandpa. Sizwe Dhlomo, who quit his job as a computer programmer in 2005 to become the first MTV Base VJ, has never looked back in his career as a radio and TV presenter. As a result, he has worked for a number of radio and television stations. And his career, which has spanned over a decade and a half, has earned him acclaim, including a nomination for the 2021 SA Radio Award.</p><h2>How old is Sizwe Dhlomo?</h2><p><strong>Sizwe Dhlomo</strong> has 39 years of age. On June 21, 1983, the well-known media personality was born in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal. His astrological sign is Cancer. Dhlomo is a Zulu tribal member.&nbsp;After becoming the first MTV Base VJ in his early twenties, his lights began to shine brilliantly on international stages. Sizwe Dhlomo has risen to prominence as one of South Africa’s most in-demand radio and television hosts.</p><h2>Who are the parents of Sizwe Dhlomo?</h2><p>Sizwe Dhlomo said in November 2022 on MacG’s Podcast and Chill that he was reared in a strict environment. He has kept his parents’ identities hidden, although he sometimes writes about them on social media. Sizwe’s father took over his father’s agricultural business while his mother taught at a school.</p><p>In one of his Instagram postings, the Kaya FM host revealed that his parents married civilly in 1982. They have been married for nearly 40 years and are still together.</p><h2>Sizwe Dhlomo’s Grandfather</h2><p>Isaac Dhlomo, a KwaZulu-Natal native, is Sizwe Dhlomo’s grandpa. During the apartheid period, he was a rich farmer who purchased property in KwaZulu-Natal. Among the farm’s four prominent sections are cattle ranching, farming, forestry, and horse breeding. Sizwe’s grandfather came from a very destitute family, despite his fame for his wealthy agricultural company.&nbsp;After his father died, Isaac Dhlomo had to drop out of school in grade 4 and begin working to support his mother and younger brothers. He finally got into farming and was rather successful at it. Furthermore, Isaac Dhlomo is said to be a strong supporter of the African National Congress (ANC).</p><p>He was claimed to have assisted Anton Lembede, the first ANC Youth League president, in becoming a partner at Pixley ka Seme legal company. In 1946, the ANCYL’s first president was named a partner in the legal business by Sizwe Dhlomo’s grandfather, who loaned Lambede close to R100,000 at the time. Furthermore, Isaac Dhlomo was friends with apartheid resistance hero Olivier Tambo and late Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda.&nbsp;Following Kaunda’s death in 2021, the media personality paid respect to him by releasing a photograph of him and Tambo taken by his grandpa.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Sizwe-Dhlomo-1.jpg alt="Sizwe Dhlomo" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Is Sizwe Dhlomo related to anyone?</h2><p>Sizwe Dhlomo is said to have two sisters, one of them is named Thobeka Dhlomo. Surprisingly, the popular radio host’s siblings live a secluded existence, and hence little information about their personal and professional lives is accessible. Sizwe is, however, believed to be the cousin of media mogul Khanyi Dhlomo.&nbsp;Khanyi Dhlomo is a 50-year-old writer and magazine editor who was born on December 17th, 1972. She has a BA in Communications and Industrial Psychology from the University of the Witwatersrand. She also earned an MBA from Harvard Business School in 2007. Then, in 1995, Sizwe Dhlomo’s cousin became SABC’s first black news anchor.</p><p>She worked as the editor of True Love Magazine for eight years before launching a media firm named Ndalo Media with Naspers in 2007. Destiny Magazine and its online extensions were also founded by her. Khanyi Dhlomo established the Luminance boutique in 2015.&nbsp;Unfortunately, her media venture, Ndalo Media, was shut down four years later. It’s worth mentioning that Khanyi was named the Most Influential Woman in South African Media in 2003 for her work.</p><h2>At the age of 22, Sizwe Dhlomo landed his first TV hosting gig.</h2><p>Dhlomo had to leave his job as a computer programmer in 2005, when he was 22 years old, to pursue a career in broadcasting. He won the talent competition on MTV Base at the time. As a result, he became the music station’s first video jockey. In the inaugural season of MTV Base World Chart Express, he received his first VJ duty.</p><p>For numerous years, he worked with music stations and interviewed celebrities such as John Legend, Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Akon, 2-Face, and Sean Paul. Sizwe Dhlomo flew to the VMAs in Scotland in 2014 as part of the MTV Base contingent from around the globe. Meanwhile, in 2010, he served as the digital presenter of the 16th South African Music Awards, which were hosted in Suncity.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Sizwe-Dhlomo-2.jpg alt="Sizwe Dhlomo" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>That same year, he started co-hosting SABC1 Live with Bonang Matheba. His tenure, however, was short, since he resigned from the position in 2011. Following that, Sizwe Dhlomo worked as a presenter on SuperSport. He was also a member of the Newsroom Afrika squad.</p><h2>Dhlomo’s Radio Career Began in the Early 2010s</h2><p>Sizwe Dhlomo left SABC1 to pursue a career in radio, joining YFM. In 2013, he departed the radio station to become a member of the 947 crew.&nbsp;While there, he worked as a broadcaster for 702 FM and Cape Talk radio. Obviously, his charisma and understanding of young culture have caused him to become one of South Africa’s most-known voices on both radio and television.</p><p>Sizwe Dhlomo was appointed as the next afternoon drive program presenter on Kaya FM in June 2020, with his career still on the rise. He took over as program host the next month, succeeding Ndumiso Ngcobo and Kgomotse Matsunyane. He is still the host of the Kaya Drive program as of this writing, and he has made the afternoon-drive show fairly famous throughout the nation.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Media Personality</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Sizwe Dhlomo</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuv8izrp5llJ25sLnOZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWWTlr%2BmsdFmnLGonKS%2FprCO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stephen-oswald-net-worth-217675.html><span>←</span><span>Stephen Oswald Net Worth</span></a>
