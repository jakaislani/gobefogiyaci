<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Extraordinary Measures movie review (2010)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>With children that young, the drama would have focused on the parents. By making Megan Crowley (<a href=#>Meredith Droeger</a>) a wise and cheerful 9-year old, "Extraordinary Measures" improves her as a story element. Her father is <a href=#>John Crowley</a> (<a href=#>Brendan Fraser</a>), an executive at Bristol-Myers Squibb. Her mother is Aileen (<a href=#>Keri Russell</a>). Neither character is developed any more deeply than the story requires. Their personal relationship is defined by their desperation as the deadlines for their children grow nearer.</p><p>Crowley discovers on the Internet a professor at the University of Nebraska named Dr. Robert Stonehill (<a href=#>Harrison Ford</a>). He's working on a controversial cure for Pompe that the medical establishment rejects, and when he won't return messages, Crowley impulsively flies to Nebraska to confront him.</p><p>Dr. Robert Stonehill doesn't exist in real life. The Pompe cure was developed by Dr. Yuan-Tsong Chen and his colleagues while he was at Duke University. He is now director of the Institute of Biomedical Science in Taiwan. Harrison Ford, as this film's executive producer, perhaps saw Stonehill as a plum role for himself; a rewrite was necessary because he couldn't very well play Dr. Chen. The real Chen, a Taiwan University graduate, worked his way up at Duke from a residency to professor and chief of medical genetics at the Duke University Medical Center. He has been mentioned as a Nobel candidate.</p><p>I suspect Dr. Chen might have inspired a more interesting character than "Dr. Stonehill." The Nebraskan seems inspired more by Harrison Ford's image and range. He plays the doctor using only a few spare parts off the shelf. (1) He likes to crank up rock music while he works. (2) He doesn't return messages. (3) He's so feckless he accidentally hangs up on Crowley by pulling the phone off his desk. (4) He likes to drink beer from longneck bottles in a honky-tonk bar and flirt with the waitress. (5) "I'm a scientist, not a doctor," he says. He's not interested in Pompe patients, only the chemistry of the disease.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46er62qkaS%2FpbXNmqmyZZ2arrTB0Z6qZmpgZn0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chelsey-rebelo.html><span>←</span><span>Chelsey Rebelo</span></a>
