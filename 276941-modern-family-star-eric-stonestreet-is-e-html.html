To make things more believable, he told her the show would include it in the last season and even asked Lloyd to send him <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SenGYaolB8k&ab_channel=TheEllenShow">fake emails</a> with “story ideas” for the mustache.</p><p class=Fg>The night before filming, Stonestreet got up in the middle of the night and shaved it. When Schweitzer woke up, she was understandably worried and confused, and he told her, “Oh my God! I sleep-shaved!” Luckily, she enjoys his pranks.</p><p class=Fg>Before Stonestreet started dating Schweitzer, he and <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/201209249413/charlize-theron-eric-stonestreet-dating/>Charlize Theron</a> sparked dating rumors.
