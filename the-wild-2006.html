<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>The Wild movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2006)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Hold that thought. "The Wild" and another recent animated film. "Madagascar," share the same premise, which is that animals escape from a zoo and find themselves back in the jungle again -- Madagascar in the first film, continental Africa in this one.</p><p>The premise this time is that little Ryan (voice by <a href=#>Greg Cipes</a>), the lion cub, has wandered off and gotten into a shipping container that is being taken to Africa. His horrified father Samson (<a href=#>Kiefer Sutherland</a>) races off to save him and ends up chasing Ryan's ship all the way to Africa on a tugboat that gets very good mileage. Along for the ride are such zoo friends as Benny the Squirrel (<a href=#>James Belushi</a>), Bridget the Giraffe (<a href=#>Janeane Garofalo</a>), Nigel the Koala (<a href=#>Eddie Izzard</a>) and Larry the Anaconda (<a href=#>Richard Kind</a>).</p><p>Benny is in love with Bridget, not realizing he is a squirrel and she is not, which reminds me of the Mammoth in "Ice Age: The Meltdown," who thinks she is a possum. The cast continues to grow. On the journey through New York, they encounter a couple of alligators in the sewer system, and in Africa, they meet other characters, including the undercover chameleons Cloak and Camo (<a href=#>Bob Joles</a> and Chris Edgerly), a vulture (Greg Berg) who I think lacks a name, and then, the earth thundering, the dreaded Kazar (<a href=#>William Shatner</a>), who is king of the wildebeests but can be king of the jungle only if he defeats a lion. That would be Samson, who has a secret in his past he hopes Kazar doesn't discover.</p><p>Now, then. Although Samson gets regular T-bones at the zoo, he would no doubt cheerfully eat many of these other animals. But what are we to make of a volcano scene with lots of flowing lava that helps set up a scenario in which it appears that Kazar plans to cook Samson? Is Kazar not a vegetarian, or did I miss something?</p><p>The movie has a lot more action than "Ice Age: The Meltdown," which was essentially one long trek. There are savage beasts (wilde and other), exploding volcanoes, rivers of lava, and so on -- some of it maybe too intense for the youngest kids. This is the third animated feature in a row (after "<a href=#>Curious George</a>" and "Ice Age: The Meltdown") which aims at children and has no serious ambition to be all things to all people, i.e., their parents. But for kids, it's OK.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lp565pXmRaWdv</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bring-him-to-me-movie-review.html><span>←</span><span>Bring Him to Me movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2024)</span></a>
