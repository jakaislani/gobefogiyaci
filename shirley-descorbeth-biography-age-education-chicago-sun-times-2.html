She was diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer. To fight it, she has to undergo chemotherapy, a double mastectomy, and radiation.</p><p>“I could be standing for half an hour, and feel like I need a nap for two hours, so it just kind of takes a toll,” Edwardson said.</p><p>She’s been missing work for the aggressive treatments.

She’ll get through this, we’ll all get through this,” she cried.</p><p>The funds raised will allow Edwardson to focus on fighting the illness, which she intends to do so with a positive attitude. “I have all of these amazing people, and support around me that don’t let me get down for very long, that tell me, I am I fighter, I am a survivor!”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shirley-descorbeth-gov-evers></span><span>Shirley Descorbeth Gov.

The League of Wisconsin Municipalities, along with area law enforcement are urging Gov. Evers and the Legislature to help put end to gun violence.</p><p>From the largest cities to rural communities, more than 180 leaders have signed a letter asking for support to curb the epidemic.</p><p>“Mass shootings and other deadly rampages have become far too common in American society,” said Wauwatosa Mayor Kathy Ehley. According to the United States Conference of Mayors, there have been 250 mass shootings so far this year.</p><p>It’s happened in our area. In 2012, seven people were killed at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin shooting in Oak Creek. Then just last year, a gunman shot four people at an office in Middleton.</p><p>“We are the ones that are most often there, we’re in town…and we see firsthand the carnage, we see firsthand the tragedy,” said Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett. “The broken hearts occur when you’ve got these tragedies. We know there’s a role for the legislature and the governor to play.”</p><p>The letter has not been discussed with Evers and the Legislature, yet. The league admits it will take patience and persistence to make a difference, but they have to start somewhere.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shirley-descorbeth-rep-gwen-moore></span><span>Shirley Descorbeth Rep.

(CBS 58) — Authorities say a fire that killed three residents of a Wisconsin group home was likely accidental and caused by smoking materials that were improperly discarded. The Fond du Lac Fire Department released the preliminary findings of its fire investigation on Tuesday.</p><p>Three people died in last Thursday’s fire at a home for intellectually disabled people in the eastern Wisconsin city of Fond du Lac. Two other residents escaped from the burning home. Officials have said the home is for adults who can care for themselves but have cognitive disabilities.</p><p>Fond du Lac Division Chief of Fire, Troy Haase, says it was one careless act that led to the deadly blaze. “We assume that a cigarette was put in a container that was combustible, missed the container or possibly on the chair, and that’s what ignited,” Haase said.</p><p>The cigarette reportedly belonged to one of the victims who died in the fire. Once it started, the fire spread quickly, including to the attic of the group home for those with disabilities.</p><p>The three victims were on the second floor. They were identified as 24-year-old Taylor Lavallee, 53-year-old Lisa Eastham, and 72-year-old Donna Frederick.</p><p>“A couple of them were moving towards the door, from the last investigation, it appears two of them were out of the bed,” Haase said.</p><p>Fire personnel says all three died from smoke inhalation. They can’t say for sure if the home had working smoke detectors because they could have melted due to the high heat.</p><p>“Either the detectors failed, they weren’t working properly, or just because of the timing and the way the heat traveled through that home, said Haase.” The home reportedly did not have sprinklers, which is not required by the state.</p><p>“Even if there would’ve been sprinklers, it might not have extinguished the fire the way we wanted, because the sprinklers would’ve been inside the fire — in this case, the fire is above the detectors, it’s in the attic, Haase added”</p><p>In total, four people have died in Fond du Lac in the last few months from fires caused by cigarettes. The fire department says this shows people need to be more aware of fire prevention.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shirley-descorbeth-facebook></span><span>Shirley Descorbeth Facebook</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shirley-descorbeth-instagram></span><span>Shirley Descorbeth Instagram</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BxvlwmYpwXu/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shirley-descorbeth-twitter></span><span>Shirley Descorbeth Twitter</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tweets by ShirleyReports</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shirley-descorbeth-youtube></span><span>Shirley Descorbeth Youtube</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKuYnr%2Btsdhmm56rk6S%2Fo7HToWSboZ%2Bcv6K8x7Jkmp%2BVYrKlwcKaq6KnnmKwqbXCmp6oZaOqu27AyKacrGViZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./savannah-jerson-net-worth-183346.html><span>←</span><span>Savannah Jerson Net Worth</span></a>
