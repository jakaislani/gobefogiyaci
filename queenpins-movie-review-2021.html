<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Queenpins movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2021)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>They were a part of a fast-rising category referred to as "pink collar criminals," "nice" suburban women who commit non-violent crimes, mostly fraud or embezzling from businesses or from community organizations like the PTA. A reality television series about this trend had an episode on the Arizona coupon case. In this film we have one of the world's most adorable people, <a href=#>Kristen Bell</a>, with her delightful "The Good Place" co-star <a href=#>Kirby Howell-Baptiste</a> as the two women who almost make a multi-million dollar crime seem cute. The opening scenes show Bell's character getting arrested before a flashback to explain what happened. She does not seem to take it too seriously, telling us that "this is a story about little old coupons."&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the details of the real story have been changed, including the names, but also backstories to make the characters more sympathetic. Bell plays Connie, whose life is smaller and sadder than she expected, following her early success as a gold-medal-winning Olympic athlete (but in a low-profile event, race-walking). After multiple, very expensive fertility treatment failures, she and her IRS auditor husband (<a href=#>Joel McHale</a>, given nothing to do) are estranged and deeply in debt.&nbsp;</p><p>Being clever with coupons makes her feel like she is making a financial contribution. "You are spending money we don't have," her husband says, looking at what was once supposed to be a nursery, now converted into what looks like a grocery warehouse. "I am not spending money!" she says. "I'm saving money!" That's the psychological illogic of coupons, referred to in the movie as the "coupon high." When we use coupons, we feel like we're getting away with something, like we're smart and special. That's one reason—beyond saving money—the scam was so successful. "We're Robin Hood," the queenpins reassure themselves. They don't call it robbery; they prefer "removing" or "separating."</p><p>The other queenpin is Connie's neighbor and close friend <a href=#>JoJo</a> (Howell-Baptiste), who was a victim of identity theft that ruined her credit and her ability to apply for jobs. She lives with her mother and is trying to be an entrepreneur with a series of YouTube videos featuring tips on saving. When Connie discovers that a complaint letter about stale cereal earned her a coupon for a free box, it's a short road to finding a $2 an hour employee at the Mexico coupon printing plant (moved from the US to save money) who is willing to send them extras. Just to make him more sympathetic, in addition to the $2 an hour, he has a pregnant wife who also works at the factory.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46qrJ6dnqW2r7%2BMpqavoZViv6bCyJ6uZmpgZ34%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pornchanok-mabklang.html><span>←</span><span>Pornchanok Mabklang movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</span></a>
