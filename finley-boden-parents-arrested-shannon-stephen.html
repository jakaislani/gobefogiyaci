Who are Finley Boden parents, Shannon Marsden And Stephen Boden?</strong></p><p>A child is a parent’s asset. However, an unimaginable crime story in which a child is killed by his own parents has shocked the entire world.&nbsp;</p><p>A mere 10-month-old kid was killed by his parents on Christmas Day in 2020, after a camping of abuse on the 10-month-old.&nbsp;</p><p>After repeatedly assaulting and burning their son, the pair was to blame for what the court heard was the “savage and brutal” murder of their son.</p><p>The 57 broken bones, 71 bruises, and two burns on Finley’s left hand—one “from a hot, flat surface” and the other maybe “from a cigarette lighter flame”—were among the injuries he sustained.</p><p>In the family’s “cluttered” and filthy terraced property in Holland Road, Old Whittington, where he slumped after cardiac arrest, feces were later discovered in the bedroom.</p><p>Let’s unfold the reason behind such horrible crime and more on the case from this article.&nbsp;</p><h2>Finley Boden Parents: Who Are Shannon Marsden And Stephen Boden?</h2><p>Shannon Marsden And Stephen Boden are the parents of Finley Boden. The couple took their child’s life, Finley, while he was just ten months old.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple used to take drugs and didn’t like taking care of the child. <a href=# rel=noopener>Shannon and Stephen</a> were involved in many drug deals even before the murder of Finley.&nbsp;</p><p>According to testimony in court, Boden and Marsden were frequent heavy cannabis users who put their son’s care behind earning money to buy the drug.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/geniuscelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Finley-Boden-parents-1.jpg><p>Text messages exchanged from the couple’s ordinary cell phone were displayed in court, and jurors were informed that it wasn’t always apparent who sent each message.</p><p>The author claimed that the “little one” had “kept me up all night” in a message on December 23, 2020, to a contact saved as “Smokey J.” “I want to bounce him off the walls, Haha,” the message said.&nbsp;</p><p>Finley Boden died in what should have been the safest place in the world for him—his own home, according to Det Insp. Stephen Shaw, who oversaw the Police investigation.</p><p>So, by all means, we can say that Boden and Marsden were not great parents who didn’t just take care of their child but also killed him.&nbsp;</p><p>Trending Now: <a href=#>Vaibhavi Upadhyay Death And Obituary: Sarabhai vs Sarabhai Actress Killed In Car Accident</a></p><h2>Finley Was Removed From His Parents Life By Social Workers</h2><p>Social workers from Derbyshire County Council decided to take Finley away from his Chesterfield-based parents as soon as he was born.</p><p>The legal bar in care cases was crossed since the authorities thought he would likely suffer “significant harm” at home.</p><p>They said Shannon Marsden and Stephen Boden were living in filth and the stench of marijuana in their unkempt home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/geniuscelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Finley.jpeg><p>The terraced residence was characterized as being “very filthy” and “at times dangerous, with feces on the floor.”</p><p>Because Stephen had previously been convicted of domestic violence against an ex-partner and the Police had previously been called after an argument, the social workers also warned that there was a risk of domestic violence.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the 10-month-old was returned to the custody of his drug-using parents after a <a href=# rel=noopener>Family Court</a> was informed that they did not constitute an unacceptable risk.</p><p>But 39 days later, on Christmas Day 2020, the baby’s parents, Shannon Marsden and Stephen Boden, brutally murdered the defenseless child.</p><p>He had sustained 150 wounds, including several fractures, burns, fractured bones, and bruises.</p><p>Also Read: <a href=#>Michigan Lois Guerro Missing Case: Is She Dead Or Alive?</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiflaO2tr%2FCnqOemqNjsLC5jp%2Bgp6SVrnqju8OepWaokaeyr8DSZpirqpWowaawjKyfmqaepLtuv9Oep6GdnmQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sauteed-brussels-sprouts.html><span>←</span><span>Sauted Brussels Sprouts</span></a>
