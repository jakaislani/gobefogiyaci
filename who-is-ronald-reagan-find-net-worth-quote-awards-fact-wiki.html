As of early 2016, it was a reported $13 million, gained mostly from his long careers as an actor and politician.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=ronald-reagan-net-worth-13-million></span>Ronald Reagan Net Worth $13 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Born in Tampico, Illinois, Reagan was the youngest son of Nelle and John Reagan. Because of his father’s line of work as a traveling salesman, the family often moved but finally settled in Dixon. He attended Dixon High School where he became involved in various activities including football, basketball, journalism and school plays. Upon matriculation, Reagan pursued higher education in Eureka College in Illinois, majoring in economics and sociology. He worked during his university years to support himself and his family, until he graduated in 1932.</p><p>Upon graduation, Reagan worked in a radio station as the sports broadcaster for baseball games. After working in the radio industry, from Des Moines he travelled to California and attended a screen test at Warner Brothers to become an actor. In 1937, he was offered work with Warner Brothers for seven years. Reagan had a successful run as an actor, making over 50 films in the course of 20 years, making him a well-known actor and also helping his net worth. Some of his projects were “Love Is on the Air”, “The Killers”, “Brother Rat” and “Knute Rockne-All American” which people consider as his breakout movie.</p><p>When the war broke out in 1941, Reagan helped the Army by serving and making over 400 training films for fellow soldiers. After his stint in the military, he went back in the world of acting, but this time serving as the president of the Screen Actors Guild. He also worked with General Electric as its spokesperson after retiring as an actor.</p><p>In 1966, Reagan switched careers and ran for governor of California. He defeated opponent Edmund Brown, and won once again in the 1970 election. While being governor, he made bold moves in California, including raising the tax to solve the state’s budget deficit. His feat in the state of California led him to be nominated as the next president of the United States of America, alongside&nbsp;George H.W. Bush as his vice-president.</p><p>In 1980, Reagan won the presidential election, and served for two terms. During his term, he increased employment, cut back on taxes of low-income workers, reduced government expenditures and strengthened foreign relations with several countries. Reagan’s goal was to encourage the American people to believe in themselves again, which was successful, leaving with high approval ratings after his term as evidence that he had achieved his mission.</p><p>In terms of his personal life, Reagan married his first wife Jane Wyman in 1940 and together they have two children. Nine years later, they filed for divorce. In 1952 he married Nancy Davis, and they have two children&nbsp;Ronald “Ron” Jr. Reagan and Patti Davis. At the age of 83, Reagan publicly disclosed his health condition of having Alzheimer’s disease. In 2004, he passed away in Bel Air, California at the age of 93.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Ronald Reagan</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$13 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 6, 1911</td></tr><tr><td>Died</td><td>2004-06-05</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Tampico, Illinois, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.85&nbsp;m, 1.85&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>103,000&nbsp;tons</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>American politician and actor, 40th President of the United States</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Dixon High School, Eureka College in Illinois</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Nancy Reagan (m. 1952 – 2004), Jane Wyman (m. 1940 – 1949)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Christine Reagan, Michael Reagan, Maureen Reagan, Christine Reagan, Michael Reagan, Patti Davis, Ron Reagan</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Nelle Reagan, John Reagan</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Neil Reagan</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>www.imdb.com/name/nm0001654</td></tr><tr><td>Allmusic</td><td>www.allmusic.com/artist/ronald-reagan-mn0000296724</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Presidential Medal of Freedom, (1993), Francis Boyer Award (1988), Razzie Awards (1982), Golden Globe Hollywood Citizenship Award (1957), Academy Award for Best Short film, Golden Boot Awards (1992)</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>Star on the Walk of Fame (1960)</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>“Love Is on the Air”, “The Killers”, “Brother Rat”, “Knute Rockne-All American”, “The Killers” (1964), “John Loves Mary”, “The Hasty Heart”, “Bedtime for Bonzo”, “Cattle Queen of Montana”, “Beyond the Line of Duty”, “Hellcats of the Navy”</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Death Valley Days, General Electric Theater, Walt Disney’s Wonderful World of Color, Connected: Coast to Coast, The Ron Reagan Show, AKC/Eukanuba National Championship</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts><tr><th>Title</th><th>Salary</th></tr><tr><td>A Brief History of the United States of America (2002)</td><td>200,000/year</td></tr><tr><td>Prisoner of War (1954)</td><td>$30,000</td></tr><tr><td>Swing Your Lady (1938)</td><td>$200 /week</td></tr><tr><td>Love Is on the Air (1937)</td><td>$200 /week</td></tr></table><table class=quotes><tr><th>Quote</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The most terrifying words in the English Language are: I’m from the Government and I’m here to help.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>[In 1985, after having additional cancer cells removed from his nose] Yesterday afternoon, when we came back from Chicago, I went over there in the White House to the doctor’s office and he did the additional work, and biopsy revealed there were some cancer cells and now I have a verdict of, my nose is clean.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>[In 1985 after having his nose surgery he arrived at the White House briefing with a patch on his nose he opened the news conference saying (with a smile)] Not wanting you to lose any sleep at night, let me explain the patch on my nose</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>[to the viewers at the 1980 presidential debate] Are you better off now than you were four years ago? Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago? Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we’re as strong as we were four years ago? And if you answer all of those questions “yes”, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for. If you don’t agree, if you don’t think that this course that we’ve been on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>[on the death of Rita Hayworth from Alzheimer’s disease, a disease which Reagan would be afflicted with just a few years after Hayworth’s death] Rita Hayworth was one of our country’s most beloved stars. Glamorous and talented, she gave us many wonderful moments on the stage and screen and delighted audiences from the time she was a young girl.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Government is a like a baby: an alimentary canal with a big appetite at one end and no sense of responsibility at the other.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Economists are people who wonder if what works in reality can also work in theory.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>We can’t help everyone but everyone can help someone.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>We have some hippies in California. For those of you who don’t know what a hippie is, he’s a fellow who has hair like Tarzan, who walks like Jane and who smells like Cheetah.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Republicans believe every day is the fourth of July, but the Democrats believe every day is April the 15th.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Government’s view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: if it moves, tax it; if it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>All great change in America starts at the dinner table.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>[To Warren Beatty] I don’t know how anybody can serve in public office without being an actor.</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Status quo, you know is Latin for “the mess we’re in”.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>I know in my heart that man is good, and that what’s right will always – eventually – triumph. And that there’s purpose and worth to each and every life.</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>[speech at the Republican National Convention, Aug. 17, 1992.] Whatever else history may say about me when I’m gone, I hope it will record that I appealed to your best hopes, not your worst fears; to your confidence rather than your doubts. My dream is that you will travel the road ahead with liberty’s lamp guiding your steps and opportunity’s arm steadying your way.</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Freedom and Security go together.</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved good-bye and “slipped the surly bonds of earth” to “touch the face of God.”</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>It isn’t that liberals are ignorant. It’s just that they know so much that isn’t so.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>[comparing politics to prostitution, known as the world’s oldest profession] Politics is supposed to be the second-oldest profession. I have come to understand that it bears a very close resemblance to the first.</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>[in a 1981 videotaped Oscar tribute] Film is forever. I’ve been trapped in some films forever myself.</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>[Notre Dame University. 17 May, 1981] The years ahead will be great ones for our country, for the cause of freedom and the spread of civilization. The West will not contain Communism, it will transcend Communism. We will not bother to denounce it, we’ll dismiss it as a sad, bizarre chapter in human history whose last pages are even now being written.</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>No arsenal or no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women.</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>The taxpayer: that’s someone who works for the federal government but doesn’t have to take the civil service examination.</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>If we ever forget that we’re one nation under God, then we will be a nation gone under.</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>Of the four wars in my lifetime, none came about because the U.S. was too strong.</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>[in 1992, regarding Bill Clinton, in a paraphrase of Lloyd Bentsen from the 1988 presidential election] This fellow they’ve nominated claims he’s the new Thomas Jefferson. Well, let me tell you something: I knew Thomas Jefferson. He was a friend of mine. And governor, you’re no Thomas Jefferson.</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>[from his Presidential Farewell Address] I’ve spoken of the shining city all my political life, but I don’t know if I ever quite communicated what I saw when I said it. But in my mind it was a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, windswept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity. And if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here. That’s how I saw it, and see it still.</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>[at the 1980 presidential debate, when Jimmy Carter accused him of opposing Medicare] There you go again.</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>If I could paraphrase a well-known statement by Will Rogers that he never met a man he didn’t like, I’m afraid we have some people around here who never met a tax they didn’t like.</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td>I can’t do a damn thing until I’m elected!</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that’s true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not.</td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td>[confirming his 1984 re-election victory to the crowd chanting “Four more years”] I think that’s just been arranged.</td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td>[During his re-election campaign in 1984] America’s future rests in a thousand dreams inside our hearts; it rests in the message of hope in songs of a man so many young Americans admire: New Jersey’s own Bruce Springsteen. And helping you make your dreams come true is what this job of mine is all about.</td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td>[His opinion of the Klingon warriors he saw during a visit to the set of Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987)] I like them. They remind me of Congress.</td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td>Tonight is a very special night, although at my age, every night is a special night.</td></tr><tr><td>37</td><td>Abortion is advocated only by persons who have themselves been born.</td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td>Approximately 80% of our air pollution stems from hydrocarbons released by vegetation, so let’s not go overboard in setting and enforcing tough emission standards.</td></tr><tr><td>39</td><td>[from a 1950s interview] Nobody ever “went Hollywood”. They were already that way when they got here. Hollywood just brought it out in them.</td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td>When I go in for a physical, they no longer ask how old I am. They just carbon-date me.</td></tr><tr><td>41</td><td>We are trying to get unemployment to go up and I think we’re going to succeed.</td></tr><tr><td>42</td><td>Well, I learned a lot . . . I went down to Latin America to find out from them and [learn] their views. You’d be surprised. They’re all individual countries.</td></tr><tr><td>43</td><td>They say hard work never hurt anybody, but I figure why take the chance.</td></tr><tr><td>44</td><td>Trees cause more pollution than automobiles.</td></tr><tr><td>45</td><td>[During a microphone check on August 11 1984, unaware that he was being broadcast] My fellow Americans, I’m pleased to tell you today that I’ve signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.</td></tr><tr><td>46</td><td>I have left orders to be awakened at any time in case of national emergency – even if I’m in a Cabinet meeting.</td></tr><tr><td>47</td><td>[Carmel, CA, June 1990] You may think this a little mystical, and I’ve said it many times before, but I believe there was a Divine Plan to place this great continent here between the two oceans to be found by peoples from every corner of the earth. I believe we were preordained to carry the torch of freedom for the world.</td></tr><tr><td>48</td><td>[on Vietnam] I have a feeling that we are doing better in the war than the people have been told.</td></tr><tr><td>49</td><td>Fascism was really the basis for the New Deal.</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>All the waste in a year from a nuclear power plant can be stored under a desk.</td></tr><tr><td>51</td><td>[in a 1984 presidential debate, referring to Walter Mondale (born 1928), who was age 56, 17 years younger than Reagan] I will not make age an issue of this campaign.

Government IS the problem!</td></tr><tr><td>53</td><td>You can tell a lot about a fellow’s character by his way of eating jellybeans.</td></tr><tr><td>54</td><td>Politics is not a bad profession.

I know that for America, there will always be a bright dawn ahead.</td></tr><tr><td>56</td><td>America is too great to dream small dreams.</td></tr><tr><td>57</td><td>[1985] I’ve been criticized for going over the heads of the Congress. So, what’s the fuss? A lot of things go over their heads.</td></tr><tr><td>58</td><td>[1980] I know what it’s like to pull the Republican lever for the first time, because I used to be a Democrat myself, and I can tell you it only hurts for a minute and then it feels just great.</td></tr><tr><td>59</td><td>[semi-consciously, to the nurse who hauled him on the gurney] Does Nancy [wife Nancy Reagan] know about us?</td></tr><tr><td>60</td><td>[to his doctors prior to going into surgery after being shot] I hope all of you are Republicans.</td></tr><tr><td>61</td><td>[to his wife after the assassination attempt] Honey, I forgot to duck.</td></tr><tr><td>62</td><td>[1980] I remember some of my own views when I was quite young. For heaven’s sake, I was even a Democrat!</td></tr><tr><td>63</td><td>[1964] I love three things in life: drama, politics and sports and I’m not sure they always come in that order.</td></tr><tr><td>64</td><td>[in the 1980 campaign] Recession is when your neighbor loses his job.

Recovery is when Jimmy Carter loses his.</td></tr><tr><td>65</td><td>The best view of government is seen on a rear view mirror as one is driving away from it.</td></tr><tr><td>66</td><td>[at the Berlin Wall, 1987] Mr. Gorbachev [Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev], tear down this wall!</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts><tr><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>His support for the UK during the Falklands War violated the Monroe Doctrine.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>According to Soviet spy Jack Barsky, the Russians were afraid of three things: AIDS, Jewish people and Ronald Reagan; with Reagan taking the top spot.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>His name is a Scottish form of the Old Norse name Ragnvaldr, meaning “advisory ruler” or “ruling council”.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>His surname comes from an Irish surname, an Anglicized form of Ó Ríagáin meaning “descendant of Riagán”, meaning “impulsive”.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>The Stephen King novel Doctor Sleep has one of the characters describe Reagan as “still having an actor’s hair after becoming President, and an actor’s charming but untrustworthy smile”.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Announced the Strategic Defense Initiative as “Star Wars” after Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (1977).</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Favorite drink was fine wine from west coast vineyards.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Doug McClelland’s 1983 book, “Hollywood on Ronald Reagan” contains comments from Reagan’s show business colleagues. Virginia Christine, famous as Mrs. Olson, TV’s spokeswoman for Folger’s Coffee, worked with the future President as recently as “The Killers.” She tersely commented on her co-star, “I just can’t place him.”.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Inducted into the Eureka College Athletics Hall of Fame in 1982.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Mentioned in the lyrics of the Sting song “Russians”. Released in 1985 while Reagan was President, the song is about the escalating tensions of the Cold War and was a critique of the way politicians on both sides were refusing to back down. It includes the line “Mr. Reagan says we will protect you, I don’t subscribe to this point of view”.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Favorite film was High Noon (1952).</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>While married to actress Jane Wyman, the couple resided at 9137 Cordell Drive in Los Angeles (CA). The estate, built in 1942, fetched $8.5 million when sold in September 2012.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Richard Nixon may have been the only US President to have actually met Elvis Presley, but Reagan’s daughter Maureen Reagan appeared with Presley in Kissin’ Cousins (1964).</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Was a Boy Scout.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>He hosted Warren Beatty at the White House for a screening of the latter’s film Reds (1981).

The original issue price was 44¢.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Erroneously attributed the “Ten Cannots” to Abraham Lincoln during the 1992 Republican National Convention (“You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong, etc.”) Lincoln has been widely and inaccurately credited with the list, but it was actually written by Rev. William J.H. Boetcker in 1916, over 60 years after Lincoln’s assassination. Maryland Lieutenant Governor (and future RNC chairman) Michael Steele made the same mistake during his speech to the 2004 Republican Convention.</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>The first US President since John F.

Some early photographs show him holding a pipe, but it never seems to have been lit. In later life he was very anti-smoking, especially since his best friend Robert Taylor died of lung cancer at the age of 57, and his older brother Neil Reagan lost a vocal chord in cancer surgery.</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>Honored world champion surfer David Nuuhiwa with a gold medal for Merit.</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>Biography in: “The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives”. Volume 7, 2003-2005, pages 446-452. Farmington Hills, MI: Thomson Gale, 2007.</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>He was of Irish descent on his father’s side, and of Scottish and English descent on his mother’s side. His paternal grandfather, John Michael Reagan, was born in Peckham, co. Kent, England, to Irish parents, and his paternal grandmother, Jennie Cusick, was born in Dixon, Illinois, also to Irish parents. His maternal grandfather, Thomas Wilson, also an Illinois native, was of Scottish descent (partly by way of Canada), and his maternal grandmother, Mary Ann Elsey, was English, from Epsom, co. Surrey. His paternal great-grandfather, Michael Regan, emigrated to the US from Ballyporeen, Ireland, in the 1860s. Ballyporeen, a tiny rural farming town in County Tipperary, is located in the south-central part of the country and its inhabitants are frequently referred to as “Midlanders”. The Regans were one of three primary families, or “clans”, that populated St. Mary’s Parish in the village of Ballyporeen. The Ronald Reagan Visitors Centre was built down the street from St. Mary’s Church following his visit to his ancestral home in the mid-1980s. The spelling of the family name Regan was changed to Reagan after they arrived in the US.</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>As Captain in the U.S. Army, Reagan signed Major Clark Gable’s discharge papers in June 1944.</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td>Emceed the first PATSY Awards show (1951) where Francis the Talking Mule was the very first winner. PATSY is an acronym for: Picture Animal Top Star of the Year.</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>The oldest man to serve as US President, he took office only 17 days before his 70th birthday and left office 17 days before his 78th. He was, in fact, older than four of the previous five presidents: John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Jimmy Carter.</td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td>Continued to play golf with several friends including Bob Hope and Kevin Costner until 1996.</td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td>Although Reagan did not formally become a Republican until 1962, he never endorsed a Democrat after Helen Gahagan 1950 and voted for Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952. He also actively campaigned for Richard Nixon in the 1960 presidential election.</td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td>Underwent hip replacement surgery in January 2001.</td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td>Reagan was the first “true blue” conservative to win the Republican nomination and be elected President since Calvin Coolidge in 1924.</td></tr><tr><td>37</td><td>His closest friend in Hollywood was Robert Taylor.</td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td>Reagan and his wife Nancy were close friends of Rock Hudson, whose death in 1985 spurred the President to provide funds for AIDS research.</td></tr><tr><td>39</td><td>Spent World War II making Army training films for Hal Roach Studios.</td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td>His state funeral service took place on the 25th anniversary of the death of his close friend and ally John Wayne.</td></tr><tr><td>41</td><td>His famous nickname “The Great Communicator”, was not earned but was requested. Reagan asked for it during his farewell address in 1989.</td></tr><tr><td>42</td><td>While as an actor he is thought of mostly as a Western/Action-Adventure star, his two best-remembered lines were from straight dramatic roles and delivered while he was flat on his back in bed, his character either dying or horribly crippled: “Win just one more for the Gipper!” in Knute Rockne All American (1940) and “Where’s the rest of me?” in Kings Row (1942).</td></tr><tr><td>43</td><td>After his presidency he and Nancy Reagan moved to 666 St. Cloud Road in Bel Air, California which Ronald lived in until his death. Nancy had the address changed from 666 to 668 due to the fact 666 is known as the devil’s number. The house is down the street from 805 St. Cloud Road, the house used in the TV show The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1990).</td></tr><tr><td>44</td><td>During the 1980 Presidential campaign, incumbent President Jimmy Carter publicly criticized Reagan for launching his campaign with a speech on states’ rights in Philadelphia, Mississippi, the site of the 1964 murder of three civil rights workers immortalized in the film Mississippi Burning (1988). Carter, a former governor of the Deep South state of Georgia who had run as a racial moderate in 1970, noted that the phrase “states’ rights” was a code word for segregation, as Southerners opposed to federally mandated integration of the races under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 claimed that such mandates “violated” state laws and local customs and were unconstitutional abrogations of the rights of their states to police themselves. Reagan, who had used his opposition to state equal housing laws to defeat Gov. Edmund G. Brown in the 1965 California governor’s race, disavowed any racist intent and the issue was ignored by most voters and pundits.</td></tr><tr><td>45</td><td>knighted by Queen Elizabeth II, received an honorary British knighthood, Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath. This entitled him to the use of the post-nominal letters GCB, but did not entitle him to be known as “Sir Ronald Reagan”. [June 1989]</td></tr><tr><td>46</td><td>Member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences (AMPAS).</td></tr><tr><td>47</td><td>His last public appearance was at Richard Nixon’s funeral in April 1994.</td></tr><tr><td>48</td><td>Member of the Eureka College cheerleading squad.</td></tr><tr><td>49</td><td>Was considered to be the most conservative United States President since Herbert Hoover.</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>Received more electoral votes than any other president in history, winning by 525 (out of 538) in his 1984 re-election campaign when he racked up 49 of 50 states in beating Jimmy Carter’s vice president Walter Mondale.</td></tr><tr><td>51</td><td>His first bid for the Presidency was actually in 1968, when he finished 3rd in the balloting at the GOP national convention behind Richard Nixon and Nelson Rockefeller. As the Constitution, in practical terms, forbids the president and vice president from being from the same state (a rule that binds the electoral college), Reagan was not considered for the vice presidency when Spiro Agnew resigned in 1973. Besides, though Reagan supported his fellow Californian Nixon for president, the two were never close. In 1976, he challenged incumbent Gerald Ford (the man whom Nixon appointed Vice President to replace Agnew) for the Republican nomination, won several primaries, but narrowly lost the nomination at the convention. Though Ford confided in people he was considering a run for the presidency in 1980 to forestall Reagan’s ascendancy, he never did and Reagan won the nomination and the presidency.</td></tr><tr><td>52</td><td>Rumored studio publicity claimed that he was scheduled to play Rick Blaine in Casablanca (1942); however, this was never the case.</td></tr><tr><td>53</td><td>He was the first former American president to die in the 21st century.</td></tr><tr><td>54</td><td>Pictured on a USA 37¢ commemorative postage stamp issued 9 February 2005. When the first-class letter rate was raised to 39¢ in January 2006, the US Postal Service received an unprecedented number of requests to reissue the stamp at the higher value. The 39¢ postage stamp was issued on 14 June 2006, using the same design as the earlier stamp.</td></tr><tr><td>55</td><td>Only United States President to have appeared in a shirt advertisement.</td></tr><tr><td>56</td><td>The former President was buried at his presidential library in Simi Valley, California.</td></tr><tr><td>57</td><td>The first President since Dwight D. Eisenhower to serve two full terms in office.</td></tr><tr><td>58</td><td>Pictured on a 60¢ memorial postage stamp issued by the Republic of the Marshall Islands 4 July, 2004, the first memorial to be issued in his honor.</td></tr><tr><td>59</td><td>A month after his death, items from his burial and week-long public viewing were selling fast on the online auction site eBay. The company has sold 780 pieces of Reagan funeral memorabilia since June 11, 2004, for a total of $66,000. The items range from programs (sold for up to $1,525 each) from the interment at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, CA, to gratitude cards given to mourners who visited his casket.</td></tr><tr><td>60</td><td>He played Chicago Cubs hurler Grover Cleveland Alexander in the film, The Winning Team (1952). He also served temporarily, as a broadcaster for WGN Radio, which broadcasts Cubs baseball games.</td></tr><tr><td>61</td><td>In the film, American Beauty (1999), the Fitts family (Chris Cooper, Allison Janney and Wes Bentley) can be seen watching one of Reagan’s wartime films, This Is the Army (1943).</td></tr><tr><td>62</td><td>He was offered, a role, in animation, of a guest appearance and an off screen voice, on The Simpsons (1989), but refused their offer.</td></tr><tr><td>63</td><td>He never actually broadcast Cubs games, he re-created them from telegraph reports while working for Des Moines radio station WHO in the 1930s. He demonstrated the technique of making it sound like he was actually at the games to Cubs broadcaster Harry Caray when he made a guest appearance during part of a Cubs telecast in the 1980s.</td></tr><tr><td>64</td><td>In 1978, after having served as governor of California but before running for President, Reagan came out against The Briggs Initiative, a ballot initiative introduced by a right-wing Republican state senator named John Briggs, which would have made it illegal for homosexuals to be employed as teachers in the California school system. Reagan strongly and vocally opposed the measure, saying that it infringed upon basic human rights and bordered on being unconstitutional. He is largely credited for turning public opinion against the measure and it was defeated in the election.</td></tr><tr><td>65</td><td>Had a photographic memory.</td></tr><tr><td>66</td><td>Became the first president to have a state funeral in Washington, D.C. since Lyndon Johnson in 1973.</td></tr><tr><td>67</td><td>Amidst the panic at the hospital after Reagan’s assassination attempt, a Secret Service agent was asked information for Reagan’s admission forms. The intern asked for Reagan’s last name. The agent, who was quite surprised at the question, responded “Reagan”. The intern then asked for Reagan’s first name. The agent, again surprised, responded “Ronald”. The intern didn’t look up, instead he unassumingly asked for Reagan’s address. The agent paused for a few moments in great surprise before saying “1600 Pennsylvania Avenue”. That got the intern’s attention.</td></tr><tr><td>68</td><td>At the time of his death he was the longest-living President of the United States, at age 93 years and 120 days. This record was broken by former President Gerald Ford on Monday, November 12, 2006. Their age difference, in days alone, was only 45 days. Reagan’s lifetime lasted 34,088 days, and Ford’s lasted 34,133 days.</td></tr><tr><td>69</td><td>Originally was a very liberal member of the Democratic Party, but eventually converted to the Republican Party in 1962, when he was fifty-one. He gave a highly acclaimed speech in support of Barry Goldwater during the 1964 Presidential election.</td></tr><tr><td>70</td><td>He was the first president to beat the “zero factor.” Before him, every president elected in a year ending in zero (beginning with 1840) had died in office.</td></tr><tr><td>71</td><td>Influenced by the Martin Scorsese film Taxi Driver (1976), John Hinckley–the son of a prominent Republican family from Colorado–tried to assassinate Reagan in 1981 in order to impress actress Jodie Foster. Foster had won her first Oscar nomination for the film, in which Robert De Niro’s character, “Travis Bickle”, tried to assassinate a liberal Democratic presidential candidate to impress Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), the woman he is obsessed with. Hinckley was acquitted by a jury on reasons of insanity and (as of 2010) remains incarcerated in a psychiatric facility.</td></tr><tr><td>72</td><td>On Tuesday, March 14, 1972, during his second term as governor of California, he expunged the criminal record of country-western singer Merle Haggard, granting him a full pardon.</td></tr><tr><td>73</td><td>Inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in 1989.</td></tr><tr><td>74</td><td>For two weeks in 1954, Reagan opened as a stand-up comic at the Ramona Room of the Hotel Last Frontier in Las Vegas, Nevada.</td></tr><tr><td>75</td><td>Although he was 30 when the United States entered World War II, he volunteered for military service. He was turned down for combat duty due to his poor eyesight.</td></tr><tr><td>76</td><td>Was the first guest of honor on the Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts, in 1973.</td></tr><tr><td>77</td><td>Because of his Alzheimer’s disease, he was unaware that his daughter Maureen Reagan had died. Wife Nancy Reagan chose not to tell him.</td></tr><tr><td>78</td><td>When Reagan’s long-time friend and first Hollywood agent, studio mogul Lew Wasserman, died on 3 June 2002, AP reported that their friendship was the subject of a controversial book called “Dark Victory: Ronald Reagan, MCA and the Mob” (1988). The book reviewed the federal investgation into the Reagan- Wasserman relationship and charges that alleged payoffs were made in the 1950s by Wasserman’s mammoth MCA agency to Reagan and some of his fellow officers of the Screen Actors Guild. Ultimately, Reagan was cleared in the inquiry.</td></tr><tr><td>79</td><td>(May 16th 2002) Awarded the United States Congressional Gold Medal for ending the “Cold War” against Russia, along with his wife Nancy Reagan, for fighting substance abuse among American youths.</td></tr><tr><td>80</td><td>While President of the USA, his Secret Service codename was “Rawhide”.</td></tr><tr><td>81</td><td>On Thursday, October 11th, 2001, he became the oldest ex-president in U. S. history, surpassing the previous record-holder, of John Adams. His own record was surpassed on Sunday, November 12, 2006, by Gerald Ford.</td></tr><tr><td>82</td><td>When he was a young man, he had a part-time job as a lifeguard. He once had to retrieve an old man’s dentures at the bottom of the pool and did so without hesitating.</td></tr><tr><td>83</td><td>Younger brother of Neil Reagan (1908-1996).</td></tr><tr><td>84</td><td>Daughter–with first wife Jane Wyman–Maureen Reagan died on Wednesday, August 8, 2001, of malignant melanoma (skin cancer) at her Sacramento, California, home.</td></tr><tr><td>85</td><td>Father of Maureen Reagan and Michael Reagan with Jane Wyman.</td></tr><tr><td>86</td><td>Was portrayed on Saturday Night Live (1975) by at least eight different actors: Chevy Chase, Randy Quaid, Charles Rocket, Harry Shearer, Robin Williams, Joe Piscopo, Phil Hartman, and Kevin Nealon.</td></tr><tr><td>87</td><td>Was presented with George Gipp’s letterman’s sweater by the University of Notre Dame football team on January 18, 1989, two days before leaving the White House, and his two-term Vice President, ‘George Herbert Walker Bush’, became President.</td></tr><tr><td>88</td><td>Member of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity.</td></tr><tr><td>89</td><td>Was a sports announcer in Des Moines, Iowa, before becoming an actor in 1937.</td></tr><tr><td>90</td><td>Son of John Edward Reagan and Nelle Clyde Wilson Reagan.</td></tr><tr><td>91</td><td>Graduate of Eureka College (1932).</td></tr><tr><td>92</td><td>President of the Screen Actors Guild from 1947 to 1952 and 1959-1960.</td></tr><tr><td>93</td><td>Governor of California.
