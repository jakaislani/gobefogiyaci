<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>The Origin PC BlackWidow Chroma Mechanical Keyboard Review</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Gamers based in the US and Canada are very likely to have heard of ORIGIN PC. The company, one of the major botique system builders, specializes in building and marketing high-end PC systems, including laptops, workstations, and of course&nbsp; gaming desktops, retailing them along with assorted services such as lifetime support and labor. More recently however, ORIGIN PC decided to diversify their product lineup and branch into selling other items such as peripherals and All-In-One liquid coolers.</p><p>The ORIGIN PC BlackWidow Chroma mechanical gaming keyboard is one of the new peripherals that the company recently released, and is what we are looking at in today's capsule review. After reading its name, a well-informed gamer has already realized that this keyboard is an exact copy of <a href=#>Razer’s BlackWidow Chroma.</a> ORIGIN PC is not trying to hide that. On the contrary, Razer is openly named as the company that supplies the switches and the software. Therefore, in every respect, this review can also be regarded as the review of the Razer BlackWidow Chroma.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/9481/OPCBWChr_04_575px.JPG style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><h3>ORIGIN PC BlackWidow Chroma Mechanical Gaming Keyboard - Key features and specifications</h3><ul><li>Razer Mechanical Switches with 50g actuation force</li><li>60 million keystroke life span</li><li>Chroma backlighting with 16.8 million customizable color options</li><li>Razer Synapse enabled</li><li>10 key roll-over anti-ghosting</li><li>Fully programmable keys with on-the-fly macro recording</li><li>5 additional dedicated macro keys</li><li>Gaming mode option</li><li>Audio-out/mic-in jacks</li><li>USB pass-through</li><li>1000Hz Ultrapolling</li><li>Braided fiber cable</li></ul><h2>Packaging & Bundle</h2><p>ORIGIN PC supplies the BlackWidow Chroma in an almost entirely plain, brown cardboard box. The only artwork on the box are the logos of ORIGIN PC and Razer, side by side. Inside the box, we found a minimal bundle offered into a black envelope with Razer’s logo on it, consisting of a quick start guide, warranty information and product registration cards, as well as two large stickers. There is no media with the software, keycap extraction tool, replacement keycaps, wrist rest or any other accessories.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/9481/OPCBWChr_01_575px.JPG style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a>&nbsp;<a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/9481/OPCBWChr_03_575px.JPG style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIZ1hJBoq6GdXaS%2FqrPIp2Spm12XuaKvyrCgnaenYrCpvs6mmGallZi1orrInJilZZuaxqO7wKubZqqVq7amww%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./staying-at-the-lalu-hotel-at-sun-moon-lake-in-yuchi-taiwan.html><span>←</span><span>Staying at The Lalu hotel, at Sun Moon Lake, in Yuchi, Taiwan</span></a>
